      "In my opinion , the car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street . At that moment you realized the importance of public transport .\r\n",
      "In India we have various types of public transport , like cycles , bikes , cars , trains & flights .\r\n",
      "Depending on the distance and duration to the desired place , the mode of transport is chosen accordingly .\r\n",
      "But generally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport .\r\n",
      "This reminds me of a trip that I have recently been to and the place is Agra .\r\n",
      "It takes around 6 hours by National highway to get from Delhi to Agra .\r\n",
      "We have stopped at hotels to have food and just in case any of us feel hungry , we have purchased some snacks just before the trip .\r\n",

      "For example Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , and Valencia .\r\n",
      "There are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit . For example , in Madrid you can visit \" Puerta del Sol \" and \" Las Cibeles \" .\r\n",
      "I visit Madrid twice a year .\r\n",
      "All summer I visit Sevilla because I love this city and I suggest that you visit Sevilla .\r\n",

      "Today , public transport still plays an important role in the transport system and it will keep on in the future .\r\n",
      "Because public transport is a cost effective and better resource allocation in the mass transport system .\r\n",
      "Also , people need not to suffer high operating costs running their own car .\r\n",
      "But they can use a cheaper way to get to their destination , especially if it is far away from home .\r\n",
      "For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane travelling to another country .\r\n",
      "Instead it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on a public plane .\r\n",
      "In my opinion , I think that public transport in the future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that do n't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport continues to have a future but people are going to use more cars than buses or underground .\r\n",
      "If we think about it , the car is better because we do n't need to wait for them . We are waiting for the bus or underground , but in another way cars cost more money than public transport .\r\n",
      "By car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unknown but if we choose public transport we can meet friends or family so both transportation are good and the cars do n't necessarily need to end up with public transport .\r\n",
      "If I had to choose between both modes of transportation I think I probably chose a car because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus .\r\n",
      "In my community , we are very interested in the environment and ecological things .\r\n",
      "We have solar panels and a place to make compost at the last garden , with worms who eat and degrade all the organic waste of the school .\r\n",
      "In some strategic points of the building we have special trashcans to separate the garbage in organic , paper and cardboard , cans and pet bottles and they also made talks and presentations about the earth 's problems like global warming , pollution , etc .\r\n",

      "When she said that , Michael started to cry and got mad saying that she was lying and did n't have a heart .\r\n",
      "He got so mad that he asked her to get out of his apartment .\r\n",
      "The following day , she said sorry and they were happy again .\r\n",
      "But when they get to the home of Michael they fight again and Michael gets a knife and kills her .\r\n",
      "He cried with a lot of blood around .\r\n",

      "Public transportation is an important invention in human history , it brings an amount of benefits to our lives .\r\n",
      "For instance , we take the subway in order to avoid getting stuck in traffic .\r\n",
      "It is true that moving by car is more convenient than taking public transportation , however , it would cause more damage to our lives and harm our environment .\r\n",
      "Therefore , we need to think more about our future and our offspring .\r\n",
      "Giving them a safe , clean and comfortable place to live .\r\n",

      "What other precautions are usually taken ?\r\n",

      "The most important option to travel is , by far , the plane .\r\n",
      "But , even when it 's true that it 's the faster option , you must be very careful in time to get off a plane .\r\n",
      "If you are looking for comfort and relax , obviously , you have to take a boat .\r\n",
      "There are a wide variety of things to do and enjoy the trip .\r\n",
      "Although , the better option is to pick out a train .\r\n",
      "There is no comparison to watching the changes in the landscape through a window , enjoying the way that you are doing and , the best part , the cheapest way to get away some days and take the routine off some days .\r\n",
      "Anyway , no matter how you go , no matter where you go .\r\n",
      "The pleasure of travelling is travelling at all .\r\n",
      "Transportation is one of the most important things in life , so we have many kinds of transportation now . We travel by car , but in the near future there will be other comfortable and easy ways to travel , like fast trains and planes that can transport you from north to south in less than hour . This will make businessmen happy and comfortable because of saving a lot of time and effort , so we hope that the government can achieve this as soon as possible .\r\n",
      "In modern societies , there are lots of friends in our daily lives .\r\n",
      "A big project could not be finished without co - operation .\r\n",
      "Friends could communicate and exchange ideas , feelings and funny things that happened around us .\r\n",
      "More importantly , parents give our lives and they teach us knowledge and skills or abilities to live in this world .\r\n",
      "In this case , families played important roles in their daily lives .\r\n",
      "The reasons are as follows :\r\n",
      "First of all , we could learn lots of skills from parents according to their own experience .\r\n",
      "For example , we could learn how to communicate with others in a friendly way , and we could also learn how to make a meal from our parents .\r\n",
      "Secondly , the families could give you some advice about how to deal with the things which will cause trouble .\r\n",
      "If difficulties were told to the families , the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation .\r\n",

      "As I did n't find anything , I went to the place he lives at and started to look for some information about his life and found people who he cares about , so as I continued to go to his house I noticed he would always go to the same house , so I decided to follow him to the house and I found out he was dating a girl she might be his girlfriend so I finally got an idea , I would drive him crazy just as he did with me , that way she would think he had problems on his mind and left him , but son I thought about it again and realized that if they did that I would try to help him , I would almost go crazy with them .\r\n",
      "But wait a minute am I really so angry to do this ?\r\n",
      "Yes !\r\n",
      "I screamed , my anger had dominated my mind . I no longer had control over my actions . I was afraid of what I had become and what I could do , but I could not control myself and the only thing I could think of was him suffering with a slow death and the satisfaction I would feel when I finally had my revenge , the best revenge .\r\n",
      "But I was so mad at him and so anxious to make his life impossible , and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the suffering I had been through became stronger and bigger . I had made a decision I was going to do it , if he dedicated 4 years of his life to touring me and not wanting me to be happy I would the time is necessary for him to have a miserable life and I wo n't stop until I have accomplished my goal .\r\n",
      "I do n't agree with this idea completely .\r\n",
      "On the one hand , travelling by car is really much more convenient as it gives you the chance to be independent .\r\n",

      "Public transportation has been more used by people and over the years it is kind of becoming cheaper and also safer but some people prefer cars to the extent we agree with and what is our reason for that is what we are going to demonstrate in this essay\r\n",
      "About 40 years ago , there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars , so in those years there was not even a good facility to move from one place to another and that is because there were no companies to build cars in about 10 years . Cars trading became viable and also became very supported by having their own fans at the beginning . They faced a lot of problems but they were able to solve them by the end .\r\n",
      "Nowadays all facilities for travelling are more convenient , from cars to buses , even trains and planes . Some people prefer cars because they like crowded places or because they find it sometimes cheaper , but from another point of view , public transportation is very cheap and even faster , but when it comes to traveling , a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy it more by chilling out from crowded places .\r\n",
      "To summarize , it is different from some oneis opinion to another . I predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more . By the end , cars will disappear and will no longer be used .\r\n",
      "The topic itself explains the uncertainty of public transport in our country .\r\n",
      "This conclusion becomes more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and exponential growth in their sales figures and with low budget private cars in the picture , scenario drastically changed in the past 10 years\r\n",
      "Development of the biodiesel industry can be a contribution to productivity growth .\r\n",
      "A large scale of investment was brought for biofuel development .\r\n",

      "If you are living in a big town or small it does matter but one thing should be taken care of by the people and organisers of the town , is the environment .\r\n",
      "Global warming is a huge issue on today 's date .\r\n",
      "The government should take immense action to stop it or at least slow it down .\r\n",
      "However we the people have a really important part of making it worse .\r\n",
      "Active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees , water and air and much more to provide a fresh , clean and safe environment for their people .\r\n",
      "Recycling items can be a good step to start with a clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taken care of by my city .\r\n",
      "Everyone has to plant a tree in front of their home with the rule of the provincial government .\r\n",
      "People are not realizing that cutting the tree can reduce the production of oxygen in the atmosphere .\r\n",
      "Eventually humans will have no more fresh air to breathe .\r\n",

      "Technology has changed people 's lives very much . In fact , we can think how different our life is either to our parents or our grandparents ' lives . For example , my parents did n't watch on tv , because there was n't any TV in the world when they were young , but it is n't the only difference : we can think at the mobile phone , the computer ed at least the internet . Our grandparents would n't imagine a strange machine like a computer in their life .\r\n",
      "Although the fact that personal vehicles like cars now are popular , in the future , the stance of public transport is still very crucial .\r\n",
      "Nowadays , people use fossil fuel as the most important source of energy for travelling and manufacturing . This source of energy does n't always maintain at a constant level , but someday it will run out .\r\n",
      "People must find ways to use other energy sources like nuclear electricity , wind power , and public transportation such as electric metro use this kind of energy .\r\n",

      "People will realise that using their own car is just to waste their time in traffic jams or to gradually kill themselves for breathing polluted air .\r\n",
      "So the best way for them to travel is public transportation .\r\n",
      "Each person should practice saving when using any source of energy to protect his own life .\r\n",

      "I like to feel the ground under my feet is soft , not the hard concrete of the footpaths in the city of the streets .\r\n",
      "The best advice I can give to someone who is starting the running is to start slowly and not to try to run too fast but then to eventually build up the running week by week so that every week you run a little further and a little faster and then after 20 years you will be an Olympic champion maybe .\r\n",

      "Television seems to be a controversial tool .\r\n",
      "Here there is one : does television offer highly likely opportunities for the audience in an educational way ?\r\n",
      "From my experience knowledge , I believe television covers both entertaining and educational functions .\r\n",
      "It notes how many educational programmes broaden young children 's horizons in the past few years , and how quickly an adult learns different basics from a great number of educational programmes , such as cooking , science and technology .\r\n",
      "It also notes educational programmes make a decision on what citizens should know in the future and what knowledge our next generations are required to possess .\r\n",
      "Apart from educational content , there are so many foul contents , business advertisements and fake information on TV that citizens wo n't be able to tell right from wrong .\r\n",

      "First of all , you can afford to buy it . After that , you must pay for the insurance , council tax , and mechanical bills , and so on .\r\n",

      "I think about transport that the government has to help public transport , for example bus , train , metro and more , for only one reason : the quality of life against pollution .\r\n",
      "Travelling by car is more convenient in a lot of situations , but it could be annoying to search for parking and for the cost of fuel , and also maintenance costs .\r\n",
      "In big cities , public transport works well because there 's good feedback from people .\r\n",
      "Instead in the small cities , it ca n't be good in the same way , because for the transport companies it 's not convenient to invest money , because fewer people would use it .\r\n",

      "public transportation . Day by day , folks are more crazy about their own vehicles , which leads to a dark future of public transportation .\r\n",
      "Firstly , I agree with the given statement that there would be tough times for public transportation in near future , because people want privacy as well as freedom , which is quite impossible in public transportation .\r\n",
      "Secondly , this mode of transportation covers\r\n",
      "as much as possible of city area or town which mismanaged routine who travelled by public transportation . As a consequence generally people avoid travelling by public transportation finally I can say that there are various modes of transportation available\r\n",

      "What they will do in the future they see , like in a fog .\r\n",
      "In this way , the idea of a year off between leaving school and starting the next education is very reasonable .\r\n",

      "Ten or eleven years at school make them tired , in spite of the fact that pupils do n't notice it .\r\n",
      "But choosing a second education is a very important step , which requires a serious attitude .\r\n",
      "Secondly such a year off would give future students a chance to try themselves in new professional spheres .\r\n",

      "With the sweeping progress of development and the booming population , many agricultural land , forests and oceans have been destroyed to build more construction and transport networks .\r\n",
      "From my own perspective , I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even humans and animals .\r\n",
      "To start with , there are a wide range of troubles that may lead to this phenomenon .\r\n",
      "Convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the present day cities are already packed with places of residence , commerce and recreation and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce .\r\n",
      "Additionally , people now continue to destroy more agriculture and forest in order to satisfy all their needs , which will destroy the ecosystem diversity and biodiversity , especially the endangered species .\r\n",
      "According to the problems mentioned above , various approaches that the government should be adopted to deal with this problem . First of all , reducing building construction from now on , planting more trees instead .\r\n",
      "Sustainable development should be awaness to all humans and start to protect the environment and preserve the animals .\r\n",

      "This is not my first time studying English .\r\n",

      "The car is n't the best way for transport , because it produces a lot of pollution , however public transport is better to do a journey .\r\n",
      "It can carry many people without problems .\r\n",
      "Nowadays in the cities developed there are many possibilities for public transport , like bus , train , subway , tram etc.These options are more economical than the car . The problem with the car is that normally the car is occupied by a person , when the car is prepared to carry four or five people .\r\n",
      "This situation creates a lot of pollution for the environment so we have more conscience for the planet 's health\r\n",
      "I want to say something about the learning of the English Language . It is hard to get to me for the next reasons :\r\n",
      "First reason : the grammar that the learners , teachers or institutes teach is like the Spanish Languaje , my native language .\r\n",
      "That I want to say , is very difficult to understand the conjunction of the verb 's in Spanish Languaje , just imagining you the same but not in your native language .\r\n",
      "Second reason . In the English syntaxis , the structure for construction paragraphs or sentences , the verb is written before the subject , but not always , Which is the rule ?\r\n",
      "Is there anyone ?\r\n",
      "The third reason :\r\n",
      "I love to play cricket .\r\n",

      "I love this game because my favourite sport man belongs to this game .\r\n",
      "His name is Mr. Sachin Ramesh Tendulakar , known as little master .\r\n",
      "Whenever I play this game , I always follow this person .\r\n",
      "His stance , style , shots , running between the wicket , everything which is most required in this game is up to the mark .\r\n",

      "I love the way he played .\r\n",
      "First , they have to decide what they can do better , batting or bowling .\r\n",

      "There are breathtaking sights on the outskirts of my hometown .\r\n",
      "In my childhood , I went there to spend my summer every year .\r\n",
      "However , it would probably disappear if the developing equipment were being set .\r\n",
      "Next to go will be , the extraction of valuable mineral will definitely lead to air pollution .\r\n",
      "There has been an example that the other town is polluted by the process of developing the mineral .\r\n",
      "No one can deny that the pollution issue is one of the utmost important things which should be prevented .\r\n",

      "After she grows up , she decides to leave and never go back to her hometown .\r\n",
      "In addition , she has no blithe memory of her childhood .\r\n",
      "One problem is that some people will consider the job opportunities that it might bring to us .\r\n",
      "Due to the mineral development , many people in our hometown can probably earn much more money than before .\r\n",
      "It seems like a sought - after chance .\r\n",
      "Nevertheless , they do not give us any promise of the vacancy .\r\n",

      "Alongside with its development , the ability to travel has eased to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another .\r\n",
      "The existence of multinationals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisation , since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen .\r\n",
      "Secondly , tourism , especially in developed countries , has played an important part in their growth from an economic point of view .\r\n",
      "There are countries , such as Greece or Bulgaria , in which the economy relies merely on tourism .\r\n",
      "If tourism influences the economy , it thereby influences the environment , and if it influences the environment it influences transport . However , people become more careful at their historical sites , this way of preserving themselves . Transport is developed both on a small and a large scale :\r\n",

      "She had to walk at least 15 minutes to get from her house to this place .\r\n",
      "The problem is the last thing she remembers is that she has been sleeping and then suddenly woke up when the window opened with the wind .\r\n",

      "In the case of transportation technology , in this twenty first century we have various options like planes that can fly with the clouds , trains that are fast and big enough to carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of miles an hour and boats that are much bigger and faster than ancient times .\r\n",
      "Although compared to ancient times we are lucky enough that we have all these options .\r\n",
      "However , if I am given the option to choose between all three , I will say plane .\r\n",
      "There are three reasons to choose this .\r\n",
      "The first reason is its speed . Compared to both other means of transportation , it can travel faster .\r\n",
      "It can travel thousands of miles in a couple of hours .\r\n",
      "As a result , people can save time .\r\n",
      "Second is safety , compared to others the chances of accidents are less .\r\n",
      "That makes it safer to travel by plane rather than by train or boat .\r\n",
      "The third one is comfort level .\r\n",
      "Plans are much more comfortable than both trains and boats .\r\n",
      "In conclusion , I will say that the plan will be my first choice of all three means of transportation .\r\n",

      "It was a nice day because I had a good time with my family .\r\n",
      "No future for public transport ? Is this claim or not ?\r\n",
      "will we see on our roads public transport after 5 or even 10 years yet ? That is really such an interesting question/\r\n",
      "I think that it all depends on the development .\r\n",
      "Now we can see that more and more people prefer travelling by car .\r\n",
      "Yes , I agree , if you planned the travelling for a long time and for a long time you would prefer to do it in a car , couse firstly youeeeell spend less time , your travelling will be comfortable , you 'll have a possibility to stop everywhere and for a long time , as you need .\r\n",
      "but if we are talking about travelling across your city , would you prefer public transport or a car ?\r\n",
      "I think that this is the question for everyone , and the answer ca n't be one for all , cause , someone can use public transport , and the economy by this not only money , but and the environment , but some people do n't like to use p.t . , cause they spend more time travelling or they simply do n't like to travel with other people .\r\n",
      "so , in my opinion , even after 10 years public transport will be crossing on our street with enough number of passengers\r\n",

      "Even if I am not very interested in training , the sport I really prefer to practice is swimming .\r\n",
      "The sensation of being embraced by the water , feeling the body quite without weight , being able to do a lot of movement that is impossible while in the air , is a wonderful state of mind .\r\n",
      "I started to practice swimming in the pool because I was n't able to swim at all , and I wanted to learn .\r\n",
      "I have been taking lessons for six months , so I improved my abilities so much .\r\n",
      "If you are not a good swimmer , you lose a big part of the pleasure of enjoying the water , either in the sea or in the pool .\r\n",
      "Practice swimming is quite hard work , especially if you need to learn the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity .\r\n",
      "I recommend that you do n't have to give up before trying , because it is fairly simple and it can give a lot of satisfaction !\r\n",

      "Introduction\r\n",
      "This report will examine the different activities we can do in our leisure time in Castelldefels .\r\n",
      "Activities to kill time\r\n",
      "As our town is well - known for our magnificent beaches along the Mediterranean coast and for the Olympic Canal of Castelldefels , many foreign or local people come here to do activities like kitesurfing and windsurfing on the beach or canoeing and aquatic skiing on the Olympic Canal .\r\n",
      "These activities are the most popular and the most expensive too .\r\n",
      "However , I fully recommend them , especially for sporty , adventurous and young people .\r\n",
      "Other ideas to have fun\r\n",
      "In Castelldefels , there are other activities less popular , but cheaper , for instance : free zumba masterclass , yoga beach , running ... as sports activities , and as social activities there are library group , theatre ...\r\n",
      "As I said , these activities are not as popular as the activities of the Olympic Canal and the beach , but their success is increasing more and more .\r\n",
      "Recommendation\r\n",
      "So , finally I suggest that it would be a great idea to combine the different types of activities , both popular and the newest .\r\n",
      "If you tried all the activities , you would have a great time here in Castelldefels !\r\n",
      "Hi Jane ,\r\n",
      "How are you ?\r\n",
      "I was glad to hear from you .\r\n",
      "I 'm writing to tell you the best way to arrive at Salou .\r\n",
      "You will come to the Reus airport , right ?\r\n",
      "Well , the airport is located just outside Reus . It 's small but it has a lot of services and transport .\r\n",
      "You have to take a bus because it is more economical than taking a taxi .\r\n",
      "The bus stops at the Salou bus station .\r\n",
      "When you get off the bus you should ask someone about Spring Street .\r\n",
      "It 's near there .\r\n",
      "You can walk to my house .\r\n",
      "Moreover , I will send you a map in order to locate the street .\r\n",
      "This is my address : 4 Spruce Avenue .\r\n",
      "I 'm planning your visit .\r\n",

      "In the first place , my qualities and professional skills seem to suit the requirements of your company .\r\n",
      "On the other hand , I have the theoretical knowledge to use the new technologies this great project requires .\r\n",
      "I am also able to lead the operations of the project responsibly and through team work to achieve the objective and to continue with the prestige that your company has .\r\n",
      "My work experience is very outstanding because I had the privilege of belonging to the \" Minera El Teniente \" as shift manager , chief of operations at \" Minera Andina \" and at the evaluation department of CODELCO projects .\r\n",

      "Guillermo Sedillo Tórrez\r\n",
      "Nowadays there are many people that are learning foreign languages . For me it is a good thing that more people learn this , but is it worth learning a foreign language ?\r\n",
      "Firstly , there are more multinational companies that need people to speak other languages , so that means that the people who know how to speak foreign languages have more opportunities to get a job in important companies , or will have more chances of being promoted .\r\n",
      "On the other hand , there are more benefits , for example , if you want to travel to another country it is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand everything without complications .\r\n",
      "Finally , learning another language gives the learner the ability to step inside the mind and context of that other culture .\r\n",
      "Today globalization is bringing the world closer . That means that there are more possibilities to have contact with other cultures , for example in literature , poetry , films , TV programs , music or some other aspect of the culture .\r\n",
      "On balance , learning foreign languages is very positive in different aspects , so if you have the positivity of learning a new language do it , because it will bring you many benefits .\r\n",

      "The aim of this report is to evaluate both bad effects and good effects from the users'opinions in the Active Leisure Club last time .\r\n",
      "First , people in this area have actually found a suitable place to enjoy their time through a wide range of activities , games which are held creatively and effectively and have been suitable for different ages .\r\n",
      "Besides , it has enough modern facilities to serve the users in the peak hours and the guiders are everywhere and ready to give help .\r\n",
      "However , there is only one thing that we dislike\r\n",
      "With the purpose of attracting more people to join the club , besides its good points , I highly recommend that they should arrange the time suitably and avoid holding the activities to avoid the problems .\r\n",
      "Given is a diagram introducing the procedures of making bank notes .\r\n",
      "Designing bank notes is the first and indispensable step .\r\n",
      "People should decide the background colour and the artwork while they have to consider the security issues .\r\n",
      "Then , skilled machinists would prepare the metal plates in order to go to the next step .\r\n",
      "The third section is to print the prepared bank notes .\r\n",
      "Usually there will be 50 ban notes per sheet .\r\n",
      "The colour will be printed on both sides and every note has their unique ink and the images will be slightly raised .\r\n",
      "After that , it comes to the most significant stage , that is inspecting the quality of the printed sheets .\r\n",
      "People usually divided the quality into three parts : Good quality , partially damaged , and bad sheets .\r\n",
      "As for good quality sheets and partially damaged sheets but still good , people will cut them separately and pack them together in order to display and distribute the bank notes .\r\n",
      "If the partially damaged sheets are bad , they will be treated as bad sheets , which will be securely distorted .\r\n",
      "In conclusion , the diagram gives a quite explicit process of making bank notes .\r\n",
      "Even though it seems to be easy to make them , every step needs people to be very careful in order to produce the perfect bank notes for everyone .\r\n",

      "He started to think how he could improve our lives and he found a solution .\r\n",
      "A concerned population\r\n",
      "While youngsters use their time trying to get concerned about the oldest people from the village about the importance of the care of our surroundings , middle - aged people planted many trees around the village and cleaned the floor of our public places , making it a more attractive place to live than we used to have .\r\n",
      "Easy recycling\r\n",
      "Local authorities helped this initiative by creating some places for people to leave their rubbish in order to be taken to the recycling center with the purpose of giving a new life to our waste .\r\n",
      "The results\r\n",
      "As a result of this attitude , since Alfred had this great idea , we enjoy one of the cleanest villages in the area .\r\n",

      "We also value that they have specialised studies in cloud technology , and hosting management .\r\n",

Because of helping them I had the best place during the concert and I had their autographs on the newest record . I did n't have many duties and none of them were unpleasant .\r\n",
      "In general I had only one duty : checking the quest list , above that I had to help in cleaning the area after the concert .\r\n",

      "First , I would like to stand out from the outstanding classmates there were in class .\r\n",
      "They were not only really clever people but also excellent co - workers .\r\n",
      "Working collaboratively is , in fact , the most interesting way of learning any subject , even English .\r\n",
      "Second , the teachers were really good at teaching .\r\n",
      "They managed to encourage all of us every day .\r\n",
      "This way we made the most of ourselves and never gave up improving our English level .\r\n",
      "Third , phonetic classes scheduled on Fridays came really in handy .\r\n",
      "They helped me to pronounce words better than before starting the course .\r\n",
      "However , in my opinion there should have been at least one native teacher in the teacher 's team .\r\n",
      "This way we had been able to hear a native speaker and I think it would have been worth practising .\r\n",
      "To wrap up the report just say that on the whole the course was fantastic and I am looking forward to signing it again next year .\r\n",

      "To be honest , I am not sure .\r\n",
      "Although privately owned cars are more and more popular , and they are increasingly becoming a common asset even in developing countries , it is not likely that this means of transport can be the means of transport of the future .\r\n",
      "Most people today realize that in our cities and on our planet there is an increasing problem of space and pollution .\r\n",
      "Carbon based fuels will not last forever .\r\n",
      "I would say that most probably private care is not \" sustainable \" in the long term , and it will be necessary to revert to some sort of public transport .\r\n",

      "Imagine this picture : in the first class of this semester , students are yawning and do not pay attention to the teacher ; while the teacher asks for the answer , students can not answer because they totally can not remember what they studied last semester .\r\n",
      "Students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying partly because after the long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned , partly because a long vacation will let students used to have fun instead of studying , and partly because of some difficult courses they should be continually studying .\r\n",
      "Therefore , I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .\r\n",
      "More reasons and details will be shed light on in the following paragraphs .\r\n",
      "To begin with , there is a general consensus that students will forget the knowledge they have learned after a long break .\r\n",
      "For example , in history class , the history teacher has to repeat teaching the history of North America before he starts to teach the history of South America at the beginning of the semester .\r\n",
      "It is a waste of time and not efficient .\r\n",
      "Next to go would be , students get used to relaxing by having no study or homework during the long vacation .\r\n",
      "For example , when the semester starts , students can not get away from the sunshine , beach , and travelling .\r\n",
      "In the class , students will recall the joyful time they had instead of paying attention to the teacher .\r\n",
      "Last but not least , some difficult courses should be continually studying rather than having a long break .\r\n",
      "For instance , learning English should be a daily education . If you have a long time without learning English , you could forget the vocabulary or the grammar .\r\n",
      "In a nutshell , based on the aforementioned , I totally agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .\r\n",

      "Most attending students at Universities are out of the city where they used to live , so they need accommodation to live through their study years .\r\n",
      "Most universities provide cheap accommodations such as shared rooms and dormitories to their students to lower the living costs , where most students have low income .\r\n",
      "Other students who may have family financial support prefer to hire an apartment to live independently\r\n",
      "Sharing houses or rooms has many advantages such as being cheap , safe , close to the university , and learning how to share everything with others . Saving money and time will be more obvious in university dormitories because monthly payments will be less than four times more than hiring an apartment , and because it will be closer to the university , saving money and time is more efficient by reducing transportation costs .\r\n",
      "In spite of all these benefits , I prefer - if I can - to live in an apartment where personality is very important for me .\r\n",
      "Many years ago , I shared a friend in a room for a few months during a course outside my country . These days when I was worst during my life , he was dirty , speaking loudly all the time and did not share the budget of eating . Living alone will grant me the freedom to live by the way that I choose and still friendly with all the others without exceeding the privacy of my friends . This matter will not be achieved when living in shared rooms .\r\n",
      "They annoy me\r\n",
      "Although the federal government which is decided as a role of the USA has many benefits according to the reading passage , the lecturer believes that there is no perfect government .\r\n",
      "The power of federalism , which has more liberty for the states to have their own policies according to their needs , is not always good for the lecture where it may create some conflicts between the states .\r\n",
      "An example of that is the marriage of homosexuals where some states admit this marriage , others do n't .\r\n",
      "Also , the reading passage declares that even if the federal government lets each state function independently , it still controls the main decisions .\r\n",
      "This case causes some problems where the lecturer mentioned the failure of the federal government to stop illegal immigration to the USA through the Nevada desert .\r\n",
      "Also , the control of the federal government is the reason why each of the states and the federal blame each other for the increase in unemployment in some states\r\n",
      "In conclusion , the federal government , which gives freedom and power , causes many problems such as no single policy and confusion in the responsibility .\r\n",
      "Travelling to a different country can be both exciting and frustrating at the same time .\r\n",
      "I think that any type of trip is exciting but also has its frustrating moments .\r\n",
      "In order to enjoy travelling to Mexico I would give two important advice ; first try to get alone with a travel companion and enjoy Mexican food instead of criticizing spicy savor .\r\n",
      "People say that in every voyage people suffer at different moments of the trip : arrive , get away to the frustration of an unknown place , get alone with your trip companion , succeed as a traveler and arrive home triumphal .\r\n",
      "In order to enjoy a trip to Mexico , I suggest that the traveler find a way to get alone with his or her companion .\r\n",
      "This minimal chance would make a big difference when you visit another city .\r\n",
      "As an example , if you are able to get alone with your travel companion , you could enjoy each moment of the trip , exchange some pictures , eat together , and visit places with common interests such as museums or malls .\r\n",
      "Other advice that I would give to people coming to Mexico is to enjoy Mexican food .\r\n",
      "Mexican food has a lot of tasting dishes from different states of the country .\r\n",
      "For example , there are a lot of American people that do n't like spicy food and also most of the time could get angry with the excess of pepper that the Mexican people used to use to prepare their food .\r\n",
      "As advice , I would suggest you ask for sauces with lower pepper .\r\n",
      "In this way , visitors would be able to enjoy Mexican food with less pepper and the same delicious savor that is so characteristic of our country .\r\n",
      "In conclusion , I offered two important pieces of advice for visitors coming to my country : Try to get alone with their companion in order to have fun and try to enjoy Mexican food because it is delicious !\r\n",
      "After the Internet was invented and revealed for the first time on August 29th 1969 , the Social Media Site ( SMS ) is the next most significant innovation that has partly replaced face to face communication .\r\n",
      "SMS such as Facebook send out 700,000 messages , and 170.000 Tweets are publicized on Twitter every 60 seconds .\r\n",
      "Unsurprisingly , the social consequences of Facebook and Twitter play an important role in communication , regardless of distance or time .\r\n",
      "However , people who use Facebook , Twitter or SMS in general , are not likely to have their own personal privacy as there is a possibility of a cycle of bullying .\r\n",
      "This essay will focus on the benefits and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter , and also comments the potential future of these implications .\r\n",
      "Communicating can be achieved , regardless of distance , through Facebook and Twitter .\r\n",
      "The benefit of being connected globally to Facebook and Twitter is that messages can be transmitted almost instantly to viewers .\r\n",
      "Firstly , Facebook and Twitter can be used when their users are in an unpleasant mood , and where their negative feelings are expressed .\r\n",
      "Secondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in touch with daily activities from friends , making observations of relationships , maintaining one 's own feelings within the network ( through wall posts , pokes , messages , etc ) ( Oldmeadow , Quinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .\r\n",
      "That is to say , human behaviour on Facebook interacts with others by sharing their mood , and receiving responses .\r\n",
      "Thirdly , Facebook can be used as an organizational communication tool in business .\r\n",
      "Knowledge about the members increases continually , and moreover , maintaining relations with other existing members , and also sharing their same interests through the social network .\r\n",
      "( Emerald Group Publishing , 2013 ) .\r\n",
      "Finally , people are allowed to follow anyone who they find enjoyable through Twitter .\r\n",
      "For instance , by following famous celebrities , people can easily see every daily activity which is posted by them .\r\n",
      "However , due to this , people who are being followed , or users in general , may have less personal privacy , and also there is a high potential of being purposely aggressive toward someone .\r\n",
      "However , information which appears on Facebook or Twitter is easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily respond to public opinion .\r\n",
      "However , information which appears on Facebook or Twitter is easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily respond to public opinion .\r\n",
      "Most Facebook users expect their friends to respond or pay attention to what they are doing .\r\n",
      "In fact , along with agreeable and pleasant comments , there are also small amounts of aggressive and even racist comments .\r\n",
      "First of all , people can post any racist comments which target a specific group or person .\r\n",
      "For example , after the premier of The Hunger Game was released , a fan posted an onset racist tweet saying that they were unhappy because one of the main actresses was performed by a black person ( Rauch and Schanz , 2013 ) .\r\n",
      "Because of the accessible information through SMS , it has led to many problems involving cycle - bullying , cycle - badgering , cycle - stalking behaviour ( Krishna , as cited in Williams & Merten , 2008 ) .\r\n",
      "For example , Krishna et al.(2013 ) reports a case of continuously disturbing a woman from a man called Mr .\r\n",

      "576.e1 - 576.e2 ) .\r\n",
      "Potentially , Facebook and Twitter , and SMS in general , may replace face to face communication and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without having to view each other 's appearances .\r\n",
      "Therefore , it would be easier to connect and keep in touch with friends within a second , rather than have to call them .\r\n",
      "The possible outcomes might be the more time people spend on SMS , the less communication skills that they have .\r\n",
      "In addition , to decrease the risk of negative comments or posts , Facebook and Twitter would improve their futures to solve the less personal privacy problem .\r\n",
      "For example , controlling what posts should be sent by adding more privacy options .\r\n",
      "However , despite the usefulness of these implications , people should pay attention that Facebook and Twitter could affect their social life by avoiding using it most of the time .\r\n",
      "In conclusion , the benefits from using Facebook and Twitter is that people can communicate and be connected to their friends frequently .\r\n",
      "Also , people can easily reduce their negative mood by sharing and expressing how they feel .\r\n",
      "In contrast , because Facebook and Twitter have been connected worldwide , which means protecting personal privacy is probably impossible .\r\n",
      "Possibly , users might express aggressive toward each other , because of lack of privacy .\r\n",

      "This practice is considered those activities that anyone can do without any kind of special preparation .\r\n",
      "However , teaching students how to apply better techniques in the moment of taking a picture should be considered as learning to draw .\r\n",
      "Both skills are required in today 's world and are necessary to be developed in the education system at the same level .\r\n",
      "The reasons\r\n",
      "Recent studies show that in the last twenty years more than 3,000 photographs have been taken per person in the world , especially in the latest generations ' lives ( teenagers and kids ) .\r\n",
      "This increase is related to the overwhelming development of technologies in computers , cameras , cellphones , etc .\r\n",

      "As far as I 'm concerned , public transportation is the best mode of transport for environmental care .\r\n",
      "In spite of some people making enough money to buy their own car , electric and hybrid cars are more expensive than traditional ones ( the ones who use gas or diesel ) so , people choose these ones and that 's because pollution is several issues that we have to deal with .\r\n",

      "The government and many companies are measuring the CO2 emissions which are being produced by industrial or service processes that are necessary for producing goods for social consumption .\r\n",
      "If people do n't use public transportation , they could walk , ride a bike or buy a traditional car , and that will probably take place when the destination is far from the place where you live .\r\n",
      "From my point of view , public transportation will be very important in the future , especially in developed countries .\r\n",

      "But such a high level of development of Egyptian civilization has the negative side as well as positive .\r\n",
      "A great amount of dams were built on the river that caused the disappearance of a lot of plants and animals .\r\n",
      "Anyway , a lot of Egyptians are still living far from the main water artery of the country and can hardly find clean water to drink .\r\n",

      "It was built in 79 A.C. by Tito , who was the Roman emperor .\r\n",
      "It was used for shows with animals or humans , who were killed without pity .\r\n",
      "Moreover , navy wars were represented in order to celebrate the Roman army .\r\n",
      "It was ruined through the ages , but now people understand its importance and take care of it .\r\n",
      "In my opinion , it is important because it remembers our past and our traditions , which we should n't forget .\r\n",
      "However , not all people are aware of it .\r\n",
      "It 's our strength and every time I go beyond I realize how many people have succeeded in building it .\r\n",

      "Travelling by car is a convenient mode of transport , but most of the population can not afford it .\r\n",
      "There are advantages and disadvantages to using public transport .\r\n",
      "Firstly , to discuss the benefits of public transport , it is cheap and affordable for all classes of people in society .\r\n",
      "A variety of buses are released by the government in order to meet people 's financial conditions .\r\n",
      "Using public transport is a time waste and no privacy are some of the disadvantages .\r\n",
      "Similarly , travelling by car has its own advantages and disadvantages .\r\n",
      "Everybody can not afford to travel by car as it is costly , but to discuss the benefits , one can enjoy high privacy during travel and it is convenient\r\n",
      "and sophisticated and can travel faster .\r\n",

      "Sometimes I think that Taipei is too crowded .\r\n",

      "However , during rush hour , there is always such a ruined person who has no public awareness at all .\r\n",
      "They occupy too many seats , including priority seats .\r\n",
      "Furthermore , most of them are students .\r\n",
      "They do n't respect other passengers , they just keep laughing and teasing each other , despite the fact that some people have told them not to do this .\r\n",
      "Moreover , I think that providing a seat to the elderly is also a problem .\r\n",
      "Priority seats are preserved for those who need them , not only the elderly but also some adults who need them .\r\n",
      "Somehow , not all of them can you identify whether their bodies feel uncomfortable merely from their appearance , which leads to some misunderstanding between them .\r\n",
      "Some people even blame them for occupying the seats instead of offering the seats .\r\n",
      "Moreover , some old people would take this considerative action for granted and they would even command young adults or students to offer their seats without manners !\r\n",
      "In my opinion , the transportation in our city has nothing to criticize except that .\r\n",
      "Everyone should develop the awareness of public manners .\r\n",

      "Documentaries can help develop critical thinking about society and the world .\r\n",
      "TV can help introduce youth to classic Hollywood films and foreign movies that they might not otherwise see .\r\n",
      "Cultural programming can open up the world of music and art for young people .\r\n",
      "But television also has negative effects : First of all , children who spend a great deal of time watching television get less exercise .\r\n",
      "In addition , these children receive less socialization with other children .\r\n",

      "If we do n't do it , one day we 'll wake up in an immortal traffic jam .\r\n",
      "But , probably , this situation is only a period of development of transport .\r\n",

      "Some people think it might take away their independence .\r\n",
      "But other people think that it is not such a bad idea , because they will be able to drink in spite of the fact that they are drivers at the moment .\r\n",
      "However , there will always be people who dislike being a driver anyway .\r\n",
      "And for people who hate public transport , there will always be .\r\n",

      "In our modern world , many people suffer from stress that spring from living conditions .\r\n",
      "In addition to this , people are working in very stressful workplaces and they want to leave this condition during holidays .\r\n",
      "Therefore , it can be said that holidays are the best option to renew the soul and revive the spirit for people .\r\n",
      "During holidays , people can get away from daily problems and also can spend more time with their friends and family .\r\n",
      "In this respect , many people prefer to go to natural places with their families in order to forget about bad situations in their lives .\r\n",
      "For example , walking on the seaside or swimming in the sea can be helpful to forget hard life conditions .\r\n",
      "On the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking clearly about their experiences in life .\r\n",
      "People can review their decisions on holidays to be more accurate and helpful .\r\n",
      "For instance , in stressful life conditions people can make bad decisions for their future .\r\n",
      "Besides , people underestimate emotional feelings in their workplaces .\r\n",
      "The reason is that people must complete their tasks in order to gain more money to maintain their lives and they forget about these emotional feelings such as love , helping people or thinking spiritual things .\r\n",
      "It can be clearly seen that on holidays people are getting closer and they remember their feelings .\r\n",
      "For example , people meet their relatives that they have n't seen for a long time .\r\n",
      "At the same time , people have a chance to go to sacred places in order to renew their spirits and souls .\r\n",
      "They can pray to God and it gives relief to people .\r\n",
      "When people remember these emotional and spiritual subjects they can become happier . Because people need to leave the material world .\r\n",
      "During holidays , people have time to review their mistakes that lead to a stressful life .\r\n",
      "In conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people in order to heal their problems and stressful life conditions .\r\n",

      "Cycling to school , to work or to do any other activity is not a common habit in Spain .\r\n",
      "However , the government and the local councils of big cities such as Madrid or Valencia , are trying their best to promote this movement because they consider it a way of development .\r\n",
      "On the one hand , there are many benefits to cycling .\r\n",
      "Firstly , it reduces traffic jams , noise and pollution , as well as lowers CO2 emissions .\r\n",
      "Furthermore , it turned out to be the quickest method of transport .\r\n",
      "On the other hand , there are some issues such as the increase of danger on the roads .\r\n",
      "Statistically cycling is generally considered to be more dangerous than travelling by car .\r\n",
      "Another disadvantage is the weather .\r\n",
      "Getting wet when it rains , having to make a lot of effort to cycle into a strong wind , freezing weather or having to keep drinking when the weather is hot .\r\n",
      "In my point of view , cycling contributes to improving community spirit and it is possible to look for solutions to face the disadvantages of this activity .\r\n",
      "No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .\r\n",
      "For example , people taking a car do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway .\r\n",
      "And this undesirable time might not be so short during holidays , due to less frequent schedules .\r\n",
      "Also , we can drive a car to any place where public transport perhaps is not able to reach .\r\n",
      "When the bus is crowded , we have to stand , making it more exhausting especially for a long distance .\r\n",
      "Even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , the advantages of travelling by public transport should not be neglected .\r\n",
      "First , public transport is good for the environment compared to private cars .\r\n",
      "As we all know , the more public transport passengers use , the less car exhausts are emitted per person .\r\n",
      "Recently , several studies have shown evidence that there is a strong relation between car exhausts and lung cancers .\r\n",
      "In other words , public transport plays an important role in protecting human beings from suffering from diseases and saving lives .\r\n",
      "Second , public transport saves city spaces .\r\n",
      "As more and more people choose to live in cities , nowadays our cities are becoming larger and more crowded .\r\n",
      "Correspondingly , the space for each person becomes more limited than before .\r\n",
      "Provided that every citizen owns a car and uses it rather than public transport for every travelling chance , I suppose that our streets would become a parking place and everyone would spend more time congesting .\r\n",
      "Last but not least , public transport allows people to do other things which are impossible when driving .\r\n",
      "The drivers have to continuously pay attention to their surroundings , resulting in a tense spirit .\r\n",
      "For a passenger , however , travelling is completely relaxing .\r\n",
      "People can listen to music , take a phone call with a friend , read a fascinating book or just loot outside .\r\n",
      "Though there are many advantages to public transport , it does not mean that public transport is the best choice for every situation .\r\n",
      "E.g. , it offers less flexibility than cars , and is less environmentally friendly than bicycles .\r\n",
      "Therefore , it is unreasonable to conclude that one mode of transport can replace others .\r\n",
      "It is better that people are aware of their pros and cons and choose a fit one .\r\n",
      "Languages for the Future\r\n",
      "Should I learn other languages ?\r\n",
      "We live in a world where day to day changes and people need to develop their skills and overcome them .\r\n",
      "I think there are many reasons to learn languages .\r\n",
      "On the one hand , it could allow you to communicate with people , know different cultures and travel around the world without the language barrier .\r\n",
      "Also in recent years , expressing yourself in English , French , German and Russian has become something essential and very important in our lives to find a job .\r\n",
      "I think a great disadvantage is the price of the course .\r\n",
      "Also I consider that it tends to be hard and takes time away from doing any other things .\r\n",
      "It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitability in the future but to achieve it they will have to be motivated and to enjoy learning .\r\n",

      "At the concert time everyone can enjoy it but nobody thinks about how they are preparing for the concert .\r\n",

      "Some of them started designing the stage , some of them checking song volume and lights .\r\n",

      "In my opinion , we should go to the restaurant because all people need a relaxing moment for doing work better than before .\r\n",
      "Firstly , we can discuss the type of food we want to eat .\r\n",
      "Actually , students eat a lot of fast food while they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to do food . For these reasons I think that the best restaurant is somewhere when they do home - made food , and a good idea is for mains course : baked potatoes , steamed vegetables and for dessert apple cake .\r\n",
      "On the other hand , we are studying architecture . Maybe we should choose a special restaurant . I like a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of windows , with a white chair , table and wall , more or less a relaxing environment , but the atmosphere is very important for dinner and I think that we must vote for this , because we will have a good night or not depending on the type of atmosphere we choose .\r\n",
      "In conclusion , I think that this type of food and atmosphere is very for us , because normally we have spoken about books , work and studies , while with this type of environment we can speak about ourselves , our family , our hobbies and all people get to know something new about other mates .\r\n",
      "I would like to go to Foster 's Hollywood .\r\n",
      "I love the food here and I think my classmates do too .\r\n",
      "You can eat the best burgers you have ever eaten .\r\n",
      "They are incredibly delicious .\r\n",
      "I do not know how to make and cook them .\r\n",
      "These burgers are my favourite food because they are amazing .\r\n",
      "I can not say how they are because you have to taste them .\r\n",
      "It is a flavour similar to staying in heaven or in paradise .\r\n",
      "I recommend you go to this restaurant and you definitely leave with a very good flavour in your mouth and a huge smile on your face .\r\n",
      "You will want to come another time .\r\n",
      "However , if you do not like burgers , you can eat whatever you want of American food and you will get the same fantastic opinion as a person who has eaten another meal .\r\n",
      "Public transport plays an important role in our modern day lives .\r\n",
      "More than a billion people use buses , taxis and trains etc as tourists , for work , meeting relatives , going to school etc .\r\n",
      "Many even use cars .\r\n",
      "Though travelling by car is more convenient , it is expensive .\r\n",
      "That is because the cost of petrol , diesel and gas is quite high in most of the countries of the world .\r\n",
      "While travelling by public transport can save a lot of money in the following ways :\r\n",
      "1 . People can save the money they spend on petrol .\r\n",
      "2 .\r\n",
      "As they have specific routes across the country , town , city and villages , it helps people to spend less in shops or restaurants on highways or even inside the city etc .\r\n",
      "I disagree with the statement stated above because in the future we are likely to have only two classes in society , the rich and the poor .\r\n",
      "Middle class is disappearing and becoming scarce day by day .\r\n",
      "It is because of high taxes on goods .\r\n",
      "So , I believe either we will have public transport or people are going to be as they were in the stone age .\r\n",
      "Public transport is even better for our environment than cars .\r\n",
      "Nowadays people have different views about reading books and watching movies .\r\n",
      "Some of them think that books are more interesting than film versions .\r\n",
      "I agree with this opinion .\r\n",
      "I tend to think that there is nothing better than reading a book .\r\n",
      "Firstly , reading helps to become a well educated person and gives a chance to develop knowledge .\r\n",
      "That 's why while you are reading you are getting a piece of information .\r\n",
      "Furthermore , books develop the imagination of the reader .\r\n",
      "When you are reading , a picture of what is happening appears in your mind .\r\n",
      "You can imagine what heroes look like , you can imagine different views , where the action takes place .\r\n",
      "And finally , I think it 's very important that you can easily take your book with you and start reading anytime you want .\r\n",
      "On the other hand , if you like being in company , the best way for you is movies .\r\n",
      "Because you can watch it with your friends .\r\n",
      "Also , many people choose movies because they like soundtracks and special effects .\r\n",
      "It was so exciting .\r\n",
      "but all these factors are not important to me .\r\n",
      "I suppose that books are better than the film version .\r\n",
      "To sum up , I 'd like to say reading is a really great thing .\r\n",
      "A girl was walking home one day .\r\n",

      "She had blond hair and she was wearing a blue dress , white gloves and black shoes .\r\n",
      "Just like her ... ''Mum I love this doll! Could you buy it for me ? '' she said .\r\n",
      "Her mum could n't deny it to her , so she bought it .\r\n",
      "Oh ! The girl had so many special moments with her dolls ! ! They looked so adorable together ! They were like twins !\r\n",
      "After some years , the girl decided that she had to move .\r\n",
      "She was eighteen years old , and she had to be independent .\r\n",
      "So she took a deep breath and put her doll in the attic just like her childhood memories .\r\n",
      "At night she heard some creepy noises from there ...\r\n",
      "She went there and there was the doll with a knife in her hand . ''Bell , why do n't you play with me anymore ? Are you bored of me?Just because I have only one eye?But you removed me from the other one .\r\n",
      "Just because I do n't have one of my gloves ? But you did it against ! ''she screamed .\r\n",
      "And then ...\r\n",
      "The next day , going to her home , her mum wanted to find her daughter .\r\n",
      "So , she went upstairs ...\r\n",
      "The girl had a knife in her neck and on the wall there was a sentence,''Why did you leave me that way ? ''\r\n",
      "Tennis is an individual sport .\r\n",
      "You just have to deal with the game .\r\n",
      "You can choose lots of places to play .\r\n",
      "You need a good pair of shoes , a tennis racket and some balls and people who play with them .\r\n",
      "Although you should be good at playing backhand or forehand , you can finally lose .\r\n",
      "This sport is not just about physical power .\r\n",

      "Like the other sports , tennis is getting more modern , fast and commercial .\r\n",
      "I mean professional tennis .\r\n",
      "Some children wanted to play tennis because of money or glory .\r\n",
      "Some of them play tennis because of their parents .\r\n",
      "That is not fair enough .\r\n",
      "Children should play games , not just tennis , because it is fun , it develops their skills , helps their physical health and so on .\r\n",
      "You can start if you are grown up anyway .\r\n",
      "It is never too late .\r\n",

      "Essay\r\n",
      "In today 's essay I am going to focus on the pros and cons of studying English abroad .\r\n",
      "Is it really worth leaving your own country for a period of time to study English ?\r\n",
      "It is true that going abroad can open new points of view about your own learning process .\r\n",
      "Talking with native English speakers is always a good thing because you will be able to judge how well or badly you are doing .\r\n",
      "Besides , it can be funny and enjoyable if you plan it properly .\r\n",
      "However , you will have to spend a considerable amount of money on it and you will not be assured of achieving your goals at all so it would be able to become a real nightmare if you are not focused on your learning tasks .\r\n",
      "From my point of view , I think the advantages overcome the disadvantages especially if you have some money saved for it .\r\n",
      "But if you do not , there is always a solution which is to use the Internet to learn everything you need .\r\n",
      "You can even talk with native speakers by using some Chat Rooms online such as Skype and others .\r\n",
      "Football , a passion\r\n",
      "When I was little I had tried a lot of sports , handball , swimming , tennis , but my favourite sport is not one of those , it is a sport that I have never imagined : Football .\r\n",
      "All my life I thought that football was a sport which was for men , not for girls , but once I tried it , I loved it .\r\n",
      "Have you ever thought about playing football ?\r\n",
      "At first , when I started to play football I did it with my classmates , who were all boys , so I used to feel a little bit uncomfortable . However , some years ago , they started to integrate me when they played , and nowadays , I love playing football with them .\r\n",
      "Now , some women and I have started to organize female matches , so I am more used to playing with girls . I never imagined that I was going to be so keen on football , but now it is part of my life .\r\n",
      "I think football is a very exciting sport , and that everybody in the world should try it at least once in his or her life .\r\n",
      "One thing you should keep in mind if you want to play football is that you have to be ready to receive some punches .\r\n",
      "I recommend a great restaurant which is in the shopping center .\r\n",
      "I have been there twice , and I like it .\r\n",

      "The service is excellent and the waiters are so pleasant and gentle .\r\n",
      "The interior is big , so all the class could stay inside without problems .\r\n",
      "The decoration is modern and cozy , and it 's got some great traditional British objects .\r\n",
      "The food is one of the best things in a restaurant that is always tasty and fresh .\r\n",
      "They 've got a lot of different dishes , traditional and modern .\r\n",
      "They have also got a lot of different types of salads , pasta and pizzas .\r\n",
      "The desserts are very good too .\r\n",
      "They 've got original ones , like sweet pizza , and traditional .\r\n",
      "There is a wide variety of ice cream .\r\n",
      "This restaurant is not too expensive , which is perfect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much money .\r\n",
      "The restaurant is in the shopping center , so we can get there by bus or by train .\r\n",
      "I think this is the best restaurant to go to at the end of the course , so we could book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually go there .\r\n",
      "During their whole life , famous people , such as politicians , film stars , and the media are accompanying them .\r\n",
      "In my view , public people deserve to have their own life , without photography .\r\n",

      "Notice any kind of failures .\r\n",
      "It seems to me that journalists might be absolutely toxic and they have defective influence on society which assess celebrities through the prism of journalistic documentary .\r\n",
      "On the other hand many of the stars sold their privacy to earn more and more money .\r\n",
      "The value of their talent and abilities are counted in the amount of tabloids scandals .\r\n",
      "Summing up , all over the world , are living famous people who do n't bring into the limelight their lives .\r\n",
      "It has been very useful a long time ago , nevertheless nowadays , there are some people who ask if public transport was suppressed , and society would save a lot of money .\r\n",
      "However , people should think about the large advantages , such as : people save money ; it is very comfortable and good for the environment .\r\n",
      "Firstly , the main reason is the cost because the people who do not have a car need to travel or commute to another place and a car is very expensive .\r\n",
      "Cars need to be repaired ; besides , if you have a car , you have to pay some taxes .\r\n",
      "In addition , these people need to have public transport for travelling around the country and city .\r\n",
      "Secondly , another reason is global warming because the atmosphere is very polluted .\r\n",
      "If you use public transport , you can be less polluted than before because there are a lot of people who travel together on only one mode of transport .\r\n",
      "Finally , the last reason is the comfort because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the centre of the city .\r\n",
      "Besides in some cities , cars can not be parked in some places , such as the old city and the city centre .\r\n",
      "Summing up , people are aware of global warming and think about the high cost of having a car .\r\n",

      "However , the important point to discuss would be whether it would be a positive change or a negative one .\r\n",
      "In the last 50 years science and technology have taken great leaps , the internet , and mobiles have made us more connected .\r\n",
      "Today , we have all the information at our finger - tips .\r\n",

      "I am convinced that using tablet computers in our everyday life is rather good .\r\n",
      "People do not need to carry a lot of books in a bag . Pupil could not say that he left a book because he has all the books in his tablet computers\r\n",

      "Such people are sure that electronic things make us stupid .\r\n",
      "They insist on not using tablets at school .\r\n",
      "Personally for me , I like books very much . When I am at home I use books because I like to smell and to touch the paper of books .\r\n",
      "I do not agree with people who think that tablets are useless .\r\n",

      "At the moment when she told him that she was pregnant , he just froze .\r\n",
      "It was too much for him .\r\n",
      "He thought it would be easier to walk away and avoid this conversation with her .\r\n",

      "It was weird how many questions and doubts came up on his head .\r\n",

      "This woman , who stands next to him , is his girlfriend , his future wife .\r\n",
      "He should be happy and hug her and celebrate this good news .\r\n",
      "But somehow he did n't feel anything .\r\n",
      "All that he felt was anxiety .\r\n",
      "He could n't handle the feeling , when she tried to touch him , to kiss and hug him .\r\n",

      "Her voice , her smile and even her body were too wrong at that moment .\r\n",
      "She could n't understand what was going on , because it was just three weeks ago when they had a conversation about kids and family and he said that he would like to have kids with her .\r\n",
      "And now , he just avoids her and he is not happy about the news .\r\n",
      "It was a big mess .\r\n",

      "In fact , I do not like to do some sports at anytime , but if I really need to do some exercises I like to go swimming in the swimming pool .\r\n",
      "Firstly , I think , the swimming pool is clearing .\r\n",
      "Such as after swimming that I have a safe and a bathroom to take a shower .\r\n",
      "Secondly , I do not like to go to the beach , this is because I do not like the big sun and sand .\r\n",
      "Third , swimming in the ocean is the most dangerous .\r\n",
      "However , I like to stay in the swimming pool during the summer .\r\n",
      "Actually , I do not know how to swim but it is my favorite sport in my whole life .\r\n",
      "Moreover , I think before any kind of sport that we should do some exercises because we need to relax our bodies first . If we do not do that , we will get dangerous while we are doing any sports .\r\n",
      "In conclusion , my opinion is I do not like to do any sports but we need to choose one kind of sport in our life and almost all people need to do it , as we can not stay at home or work all the time .\r\n",
      "Even if you really do not like to do exercise , you can go to the shop .\r\n",
      "The purpose of this report is to outline the most important actions which have been taken in our town to protect the environment as the main issue to improve our quality of life .\r\n",
      "In the first place , we need to pay attention to the fact that Caceres is located in a pasture area where local farmers have been breeding sheep , cows and pigs for centuries in spite of the hard weather conditions such as high temperatures and terrible drought in summer .\r\n",
      "As a result , our water resources are difficult to preserve and it is clearly necessary to maintain active campaigns to raise people 's awareness about the importance of a rational use of it .\r\n",
      "The local government is also taking strong action on creating green areas in different places in or around the town where citizens can spend their free time or even do sports .\r\n",
      "That 's the reason why it has been working on the recovery of some areas which are now parks or recreational areas .\r\n",
      "Finally , the town has also improved the management and treatment of waste system with the active cooperation of most of the citizens who are really concerned about the recycling of waste needs .\r\n",
      "In fact , around 90% of Caceres inhabitants are said to sort and recycle their rubbish by taking it out to the yellow , green and blue containers in every street .\r\n",
      "And that is the negative point . These dumpsters are too visible in town and it would be advisable to change the ones we have for underground ones .\r\n",
      "I woke up today and I just remembered that I was doing a presentation about landscapes , and the ones that do it will reward a bonus point but anyway this is n't important information .\r\n",
      "I searched for my family in the house and there was no one in the home , just me .\r\n",
      "I get a bit scared so I search for them outside in the streets .\r\n",
      "I did n't know that a bomb hit the city and killed almost everyone , now I have to find my parents .\r\n",
      "I think the reason why I did n't know about the explosion is because this part where I live is a very poor area and it 's not that beautiful so you ca n't distinguish where the explosion hit .\r\n",
      "Finally in some days I found some neighbors with some food . I was starving to death so I ate a lot .\r\n",
      "We made some incentives about laws , but it was a total conflict , because the group noticed that some food was missing somehow .\r\n",
      "I think that someone drags some of the food at night while everybody is sleeping .\r\n",
      "So everybody is going to try to enforce the laws .\r\n",
      "The next morning I ate a piece of steak and the group was talking about some creatures that were walking around to kill and eat us .\r\n",
      "At night I was thinking about many things just when I heard some noises .\r\n",
      "I stalked him and it seemed that this guy had a hump .\r\n",
      "I stomped him and when he turned around it was a woman from the group .\r\n",
      "We were talking about this when a dog just came near ; it was adorable just when he converted into a big weird creature .\r\n",
      "He bit my leg and it hurt a lot . We tried to alert the others but it was too late , it was the group or us .\r\n",
      "We saw the beast eating our friends and the food .\r\n",
      "In some ways she robbed the food at night and when I woke up it was good for my survival .\r\n",

      "Why do you have to exercise ?\r\n",
      "What benefits do you obtain while exercising ?\r\n",
      "Do you know that 75% of people in Mexico do n't practice any type of exercise ? This is a big problem for our society and is the problem number 1 of why Mexico is the country with the most obese in the world .\r\n",
      "Doing exercise is an important thing to do in a healthy and happy life , while you exercise you feel well with yourself and your body .\r\n",

      "Nowadays there 's a lot of different types of exercising , you can do any sport , like soccer , basketball , baseball , or you can simply go to the GYM or practise Crossfit or something like that .\r\n",
      "Soccer is a great sport where you can make a lot of friends , you can stay fit , but you also need some skills because it 's not easy to control the ball and dribble your rivals on the field .\r\n",
      "I recommend you to do any sport you like and enjoy every second you spend exercising .\r\n",
      "Thanks and start now , you wo n't regret it .\r\n",
      "Is there any future for public transport , for travelling by car is much more convenient ?\r\n",
      "Many disagree about public transport which is disappearing , though we still have to deal with different opinions about the increase in travelling .\r\n",
      "This composition will explain the two different opinions .\r\n",
      "Firstly , the car is more convenient because there is privacy .\r\n",
      "Also , unlike public transport such as buses and the underground , you have much more comfort and speed .\r\n",
      "There is a perception that a car can give you freedom of choice .\r\n",
      "On the website of The Scottish Government ( publication \" Young people and transport \" ) , a 12 - 14 year old boy explained \" - I prefer going in the car , it 's quicker ...\r\n",
      "There 's not as many people around you ... I prefer the car because you can listen to music as well . \"\r\n",
      "Although there are many positive points about private cars , there are also negative ones .\r\n",
      "Indeed , cars increase pollution , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensive . \" - On my wage , even the driving lessons are expensive .\r\n",
      "Then just owning a car and looking after your car , insurance , tax , etc .\r\n",
      "Obviously it would benefit me if I worked in Edinburgh , but I do n't work in Edinburgh .\r\n",
      "\" says a 17 - 22 year old boy .\r\n",
      "Now , secondly , travelling by public transport is cheaper ( we do n't pay any fees on public transport , but also , it is safer ,\r\n",
      "According to The Saigon Times , there are a lot of traffic accidents which occurred in private cars .\r\n",
      "The main reason is that the car owners are drunk when driving .\r\n",
      "It is clear that if they took a bus or a taxi when they were drunk , they would not have as many accidents .\r\n",
      "Finally , many developed countries in the world , such as England , America , Canada , Japan and so on , have built a public transport system , so the traffic jams have decreased .\r\n",
      "As a result , the economy has been increasing .\r\n",
      "From this analysis , it is obvious that travelling by public transport is very important .\r\n",
      "Topic :\r\n",
      "Do you agree or disagree \" Always telling the truth is considered the most important thing in a relationship \" ?\r\n",
      "Disagreement on always telling the truth be the most important point in a relationship will be my opinion .\r\n",
      "Even though being truthful is crucial in a relationship , always telling the truth would be considered as hurting others ' feelings and is unwise .\r\n",
      "Another reason for not telling the truth all the time is if it is about personal matters and it would feel awkward to mention to colleagues or the employer .\r\n",
      "It is better to tell a little white lie at this moment .\r\n",
      "To further illustrate the first point above , could hurt one 's feelings by telling the truth at all times .\r\n",
      "For example , if some woman you are acquainted with is wearing inappropriate clothes that do not fit the occasion .\r\n",
      "People usually tend not to tell her the truth since it could make her feel .\r\n",
      "Instead of doing so , people may praise her with other things on her .\r\n",
      "In that case , they could still make conversions without boiling her mood .\r\n",
      "The other point is when it comes to personal matters , people usually intend to keep it private since most of the time it is strange and inappropriate to talk oneself too much to people at work or even people that one just got acquainted with .\r\n",
      "If there are questions about things one does not want other people to know , they might say a little white lie which usually does not matter too much .\r\n",
      "If I was having a day off to go to a doctor , I would prefer other people from asking details about it by saying that I just had some errands to run .\r\n",
      "These are the two opinions of mine on telling the truth or not .\r\n",
      "Last Friday , Michael and I were in school playing happily with each other in the classroom .\r\n",
      "When we were in class , suddenly Michael walked towards the door .\r\n",
      "Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .\r\n",
      "Due to this , we were both called to meet the headmaster .\r\n",
      "I could n't understand why we needed to meet the headmaster just because Michael had closed the door .\r\n",
      "The door did n't break into pieces or fall down .\r\n",
      "My curiosity had put me in big trouble .\r\n",
      "I asked the headmaster in a polite way and hopefully he could give me the answer I wanted .\r\n",
      "However , things did n't happen like I hoped .\r\n",
      "I ended up getting expelled from the school because the teacher and the classmates suspected Michael and I stole our classmate - Sally 's wallet .\r\n",
      "I could n't imagine the teacher and friends also pointed at us firmly and without being given any chance for us to speak out .\r\n",
      "I finally realised that everything was a trap and we were the unlucky and innocent ones as we fell into the trap .\r\n",
      "We wiped off our tears , and waved our hands when we left the school .\r\n",
      "Although , one day later the headmaster found out the truth through CCTV , we refused to return to the school and decided to change to a new school as we know even if we go back this time , similar cases could happen next time .\r\n",
      "This is because the teacher has a biased mindset .\r\n",

I could actually be the # revolutionary guy that helps everyone that was in my # skeptick and I was really positive about it but # notwithstanding , I would n't actually sacrifice myself . I have to think about if it helps the entire world or just saves a group . The decision was in my hands . It was # conventional to help the entire world but I did n't want to die . While I was thinking about that , we found a body that was a familiar body from someone that was in the group of those guys we wanted to find alive and not eaten by walkers .\r\n",
      "We needed to find the ones that were still alive or at least tell us what happened to everyone . The # battle against hunger started everyone was hungry and we haven't eaten anything in a few days and that could lead us to two things dead or eaten away by a walker so we needed to find something that was a # nutritional based food where we could eat with no problem and be ok .\r\n",
      "We found a pharmacy and a restroom where we could get a rest and take a shower to clean ourselves .\r\n",
      "We got close to the pharmacy . There were no walkers inside so we ran into the pharmacy and closed all the doors and I got someone to check us in the night . I needed some rest and went to sleep immediately .\r\n",

      "There is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , film stars , politicians or people who work in the music industry deserve to have a private life , deserve not to be under constant observation .\r\n",
      "To my mind there should be a board between paparazzi work and the privacy of famous people .\r\n",
      "In my opinion , big stars should be able to relax and take some private time .\r\n",
      "As far as I 'm concerned there is no one who feels comfortable when is under surveillance of people who wait to take pictures which shows them in embarrassing situations .\r\n",
      "Unfortunately , this is a part of a celeb 's ' work ' so they have to take it into account .\r\n",
      "But on the other hand , there should be some inviolable spheres of life without journalists following them all the time .\r\n",

      "As I have an interest in thrillers , I decided to give it a try .\r\n",
      "The poster of the film already offered a sense of intrigue and mystery which made me take the decision to watch this film .\r\n",
      "The film starts by putting yourself in the flesh of the main character , who is a 16-year - old boy who finds himself imprisoned in a cage and being transported to what seems to be a camp .\r\n",

      "I heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to have a rush of adrenaline while enjoying a solid story which will leave no one indifferent .\r\n",
      "I 've been playing volleyball for 12 years now and hopefully many more . What I love about it is first of all that tall or small , anyone could play it as long as they 're determined so basically it is a life long sport for everyone .\r\n",
      "I love the speed of volleyball , most of the time it 's quick and if you blink you probably miss something , each contact happens in less than a second , and still every player directs the location of the ball in that amount of time and then there 's the intensity , if you haven't seen a game go until 32 - 30 , and see the energy on the floor and hear the noise from the crowd you 're missing out .\r\n",
      "Personally winning such a set makes me feel like I could do anything , but when I do n't , it still keeps me wanting more .\r\n",

      "All the ingredients were clearly fresh and of the highest quality .\r\n",
      "The price was n't reasonable at all , because the meal came to about forty euros per person , so this restaurant is a little expensive .\r\n",

      "Cannabis , heroin , and speed are some examples of substances that are really well - known to all of us .\r\n",
      "Legalization of drugs is a very used argument by people who believe that this measure could solve the problem of exclusion .\r\n",
      "Margination has a link with the illegality of this activity .\r\n",
      "Also this illegality is the guilt for the attraction of the drugs because the majority of people start taking drugs because they are young and its prohibition is very stimulating .\r\n",
      "The real problem comes when this entertainment becomes an addiction that can destroy our lives .\r\n",
      "I think everyone has proved some kind of illegal drug to have fun , enjoy friends or just to prove them , and I do not believe that behaviour is wrong because everyone needs to experiment and try new things .\r\n",
      "But we have to be responsible and be very clear that it is only something exceptional and not our daily life because it is very dangerous as some people are not able to put deadlines to themselves .\r\n",
      "Finally , legalization of drugs means that they could be taxable and we know how the taxes work in our country so I do not know if it is a good idea or not .\r\n",

      "In Madrid you can go to visit some museums , like the Reina Sofáa or El Prado .\r\n",

      "He is the eldest son of the Simpson family .\r\n",
      "Bart is ten years old and is a typical American child .\r\n",
      "He has yellow skin and big eyes , he is blond and has gotspiky hair .\r\n",
      "Bart always wears a red T - shirt and blue shorts .\r\n",
      "The most important thing for Bart is to be the most popular student in his school , for this reason he is always misbehaving .\r\n",
      "His parents and the school principal often punish him .\r\n",
      "Bart is an energetic and clever student but he is also a bad student and he hates nerds .\r\n",
      "Although he is rather naughty , he actually has a heart of gold because he helps his sister when she needs him .\r\n",
      "In the Simpson family , all the characters are very funny .\r\n",
      "A lot of magazines say The Simpsons is the best cartoon series in history and I absolutely agree .\r\n",
      "For me , Bart is funnier than Homer , although most magazines say that Homer is the best character\r\n",
      "It was a dreary rainy Sunday morning .\r\n",
      "I was n't in the mood to go out anyway .\r\n",
      "Everything suggested that I wo n't get out of the house for quite a while .\r\n",
      "Suddenly , there was a heavy knock on the door .\r\n",
      "Who on Earth could that be ?\r\n",
      "Who would have even bothered to pay me a visit during this bloody awful weather ?\r\n",
      "My concerns were answered swiftly , for the man on my threshold yelled : \" I have a letter for Mr. Samson !\r\n",
      "\" I was quite surprised , to be honest , I had n't received a letter for months .\r\n",
      "I opened it and quickly scanned the text .\r\n",
      "At first , I had observed the letter cautiously , but then I noticed my uncle 's name in it .\r\n",
      "Although , I had n't met him a single time , this letter was his last will and I learned that I inherited a good deal of money .\r\n",
      "Fifty thousand pounds , to be precise .\r\n",

      "Actually , this town is located in the middle of hills and a river without water .\r\n",
      "I am very much worried about the town where I am staying because everybody in this town is not bothered about rubbish things they do every day .\r\n",
      "First of all , they are very dirty by nature .\r\n",
      "They are very casual about the environment and the importance of cleanliness .\r\n",
      "So called people of good nature are inactive and talkative and gossip of others not doing anything for the betterment of their own town .\r\n",
      "All the households near the public road throw dirty things easily and do n't even bother about the order of the municipality .\r\n",
      "I saw all these during my morning walk .\r\n",
      "What I feel is that everyone who is staying in the town should at least keep their own front and sides surrounding them clean .\r\n",
      "I am upset about it and whenever I get a chance I speak with my fellow people and look for their feedback but they are also the same in nature .\r\n",

      "Nowadays , public transport has become a major topic .\r\n",
      "The idea of leaving public transportation aside is widely supported in developed countries , but this idea is rejected in developing countries , like the one I live in .\r\n",
      "As a matter of fact , car ownership has increased over the last decades , reducing the number of people using public transport .\r\n",
      "The possibility of travelling in their own cars is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or even worse , the idea of wasting time in a long queue .\r\n",
      "Nevertheless , you have another side to this reality .\r\n",
      "There are people who can not afford to have their own cars or maybe they can afford to travel by any other means of transportation than the ones provided by the local government .\r\n",
      "There are countries where gas is so expensive that people choose to pay the bus fee rather than paying for a full tank .\r\n",
      "Similarly , people in countries with less income turn to these services because it is a way to reduce their overall expenses .\r\n",
      "To conclude , the future of public transport will depend on the usage people give it .\r\n",
      "There will be countries in which there will be no need for it , and in others where they will need it as long as their economy needs it .\r\n",
      "People need easy , fast and cheap solutions .\r\n",
      "In general , using a car is easier than taking a train or a bus .\r\n",
      "It 's just near your house or your office .\r\n",
      "You do n't have to go to a station by walking , carrying weight , or suffering because of the rain or the snow .\r\n",
      "But if you are sleepy , tired , bored , or simply do n't like to drive , you can find it easier to take public transport .\r\n",
      "And also more enjoyable : you can relax listening to music and looking around , or reading newspapers and books .\r\n",
      "Is the car faster than public transport ?\r\n",
      "It depends .\r\n",
      "Traffic can affect cars and buses at the same level .\r\n",
      "Sometimes cars are faster than buses , sometimes buses are faster .\r\n",
      "Speed trains are always faster than cars .\r\n",
      "Speaking about money ? Travelling by car seems cheaper than public transport .\r\n",
      "But , if we consider all the expenses ( buying the car , paying the insurance , etc . ) , maybe cars are not so cheap .\r\n",
      "In fact , in every aspect there are pros and cons .\r\n",
      "What about the environment and the quality of life in the cities ?\r\n",
      "Public transport is absolutely better .\r\n",
      "So , even if travelling by car can be more convenient at a personal level , public transport has to be preferred by good citizens and strongly supported by governments .\r\n",

      "He ca n't dump Angy just like that , they 've been friends for years .\r\n",

      "Probably , even tomorrow .\r\n",
      "It all started in such an idiotic way .\r\n",
      "The door of his room was opened , he came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist and Angelina happened to pop in to borrow a lighter or matches or something to light up a cigarette .\r\n",
      "Mike ca n't really say why they ended up having sex - perhaps , at the time he was pissed at himself for not having balls to get the girl he loved because of all these religious issues , Malika 's family and so on , but this is what happened .\r\n",
      "And that definitely was not the right thing to do .\r\n",
      "At that moment he did n't realise that .\r\n",

      "I 'm good at school , my marks could prove it ; I have worked hard since the beginning of the school year .\r\n",
      "These days I started studying English in particular because it is the most important language in the world , so I need to know it well if I want to communicate with other people from other countries .\r\n",
      "School is my life : I study about seven hours a day , especially math and electronics , which are the subjects that I like more .\r\n",
      "My teachers are very good at their job so I hope to be like them one day .\r\n",
      "The big problem in my class is the majority of my classmates : they are hopeful at school and they waste time doing nothing at school and I think even at home .\r\n",
      "The thing that annoys me more is that they copy all the time from me and the other good students .\r\n",
      "However , I do n't hate them at all ; they are very funny and kind people when they want .\r\n",
      "Coming back to my dream , I would like to carry on with my studies in London , at the Imperial college .\r\n",
      "I hope to be at a good English level because next year I am going to take the intermediate certificate of English and then I am going to try to enter this school even if I know that it 's very difficult ; the Imperial College of London is one of the most important universities in the whole world .\r\n",
      "Puerquitour : A great experience for your mouth .\r\n",
      "Nowadays it is difficult to find people who enjoy the food as much as I do , because of the calories , the kilos they are going to gain and all that stuff .\r\n",
      "I arrived in Mexico City one month ago and I met an old friend from high school , Vicente .\r\n",
      "We discovered our fascination with food and ' The Puerquitour ' was born .\r\n",
      "Then a brainstorm about meals and places to visit began .\r\n",
      "The first day started on an important date … Taco Day !\r\n",
      "Tacontento was the place we chose and we really enjoyed alambre al pastor and grilled onions , accompanied by cold beers .\r\n",
      "Because Puerquitour is something to share , the second day we shared it with Diana , one of my friends from Vancouver .\r\n",
      "Again we ate tacos , but this time they were special .\r\n",
      "The name of the place is Tacos La Chule and tacos are gourmet there .\r\n",
      "It means that they have different tastes of tortillas -vanilla , strawberry , chipotle , nopal , and walnut , among others- and salsas -tamarind , guava , mango , guacamole , etc .\r\n",
      "That day did not finish with the tacos , after a walk in Reforma and a long pause in The Independence Angel we went to the movie theatre to watch the art movie Renoir while we ate crepes .\r\n",
      "Third day was one of my favourite , the place is soooooo nice and the decoration and even the attire of the waitresses makes you feel into the 50s .\r\n",
      "La Papa Guapa , which is located in La Condesa , offers baked potatoes with names of famous women and lovely drinks .\r\n",
      "Totally recommended !\r\n",
      "Mar Azul Resturant , in the north of Mexico City , was the allocation for the fourth day of Puerquitour .\r\n",
      "Seafood is delicious there . My recommendations are breaded shrimp , fish fillet , shrimp Al Pastor and coconut water .\r\n",
      "On the fifth day , it was time to eat more tacos , the place ? … El asadero Hidalguense .\r\n",
      "You have to be starving to eat a molcajete by yourself , it is just too much for one person , so if you do not eat breakfast it is a good option or you can share it with an amazing company as I did .\r\n",
      "Do n't forget to ask for a litter of beer .\r\n",
      "Almost a week in Puerquitour .\r\n",
      "The sixth day was to celebrate Magda 's final test , a friend from high school , who already presented it to get the Master 's Degree ; and the farewell of Vicente , who is already in the USA , and that I will go to the UK .\r\n",
      "Because we like the food , we celebrated eating in Memelas Pub .\r\n",
      "You ca n't go there and do n't eat memelas , which is like huarache but bigger and very delicious .\r\n",
      "The dessert ?\r\n",
      "Ice cream in Tepoznieves .\r\n",
      "Because Vic was almost on foot in the USA , we spent all day together .\r\n",
      "The seventh day started with a really nice breakfast , gourmet sandwiches and rose petal tea .\r\n",
      "Then we went to a book fair and visited some bookstores downtown .\r\n",
      "The plan was to have dinner at Hilaria Gastrobar for all the good comments about it , but that day it was closed ; so we decided to eat at El Huequito the traditional Al Pastor Special accompanied by black beer .\r\n",
      "The last day of The Puerquitour was accomplished with my favourite dessert , a strawberry cheesecake at Starbucks and a long talk about nothing and everything .\r\n",
      "I love to spend time doing what I like and with people I love .\r\n",
      "Do n't forget to practise and enjoy Puerquitour ! !\r\n",
      "These first two chapters extracted from Great Expectations by Charles Dickens introduce a young boy known as Pip .\r\n",
      "This kid has been raised by his sister , a person who mistreats Pip and her own husband .\r\n",
      "Sadly , Pip has no fortune in any possible way .\r\n",
      "Moreover , he is just a regular kid with a terrible life .\r\n",
      "Besides this , Pip seems to be a shy and intelligent kid .\r\n",
      "He does not use complex words when he talks , but he uses them when he narrates .\r\n",
      "Also , his life would be perfect to create a dark comedy based on the undesirable life of a kid who only feels comfortable when he visits the tombstones of his parents .\r\n",
      "Obviously , nobody would like to live his life , but I think everyone would tend to feel sad reading these chapters and , finally , like him .\r\n",
      "At least , I feel sorry for him and I would like to find that his story has a good ending .\r\n",
      "He looks like a good boy that lives in hell and the Devil is his sister .\r\n",
      "Nevertheless , the narrator is the true protagonist and the way to tell the actions is the reason why the story can connect with the reader .\r\n",
      "Actually , the narrator is our protagonist , but he tells the story as an adult .\r\n",
      "And the author does not try to describe the protagonist with words , but with actions .\r\n",
      "The narrator did not use any description of the protagonist apart from his name .\r\n",
      "Also , the narrator mainly uses direct speech , but he only uses indirect speech on just a few occasions , referring to his own words .\r\n",
      "This exception can be read at the end of the first chapter , where the narrator answers the thief writing that he said that he would get him the file , and that he would get him what broken bits of food he could , and he would come to the thief at the Battery .\r\n",
      "Apart from this , he just writes exactly what the characters say .\r\n",
      "The voice is in the first person and uses a subjective point of view .\r\n",
      "He only knows what he sees and he thinks about it , but he does not have any omniscient power .\r\n",
      "However , his power could be analyzing and describing situations with a rich vocabulary and in a reflexive way too .\r\n",
      "Also , he describes his parents in a hilarious way , imagining his father as a square , stout , dark man , with curly black hair just looking at their tombstone .\r\n",
      "These twisted and creative thoughts are spread all over the text , accompanied by even more twisted reflections like at the end of the first chapter , when he describes the man who stole him as a man afraid of the dead bodies in the graveyard just because he saw him hugging himself .\r\n",
      "Beside this , the characters of the novel seem to be unhappy , living a sad and boring life that pushes them to abuse our protagonist , with the exception of Joe .\r\n",
      "The narrator does not make an effort to describe psychologically the other characters , he focuses on their appearance .\r\n",
      "Actually , we only know that Mrs. Joe tries to make her husband and her brother suffer and she worries more about what their neighbors think about her rather than worrying about the person who lives in his own house .\r\n",
      "The narrator describes her as a woman who has earned a good reputation for being aggressive with his little brother .\r\n",
      "And we know that Joe is a good man because the protagonist describes him as mild , good - natured , sweet - tempered , easy - going and foolish , but that is all we know about them .\r\n",
      "Also , the way the characters talk is opposed to the way the narrator writes .\r\n",
      "In fact , the dialogues of each character are not longer than more than two sentences , with the only exception of the thief who talks about his partner in twelve long sentences with complex structures .\r\n",
      "This kind of structure is widely used by the narrator , but the characters usually talk in short and simple sentences .\r\n",
      "For instance , here is an excerpt of the narrator at the beginning of the second chapter :\r\n",
      "\" My sister , Mrs. Joe Gargery , was more than twenty years older than me , and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up \" by hand . \"\r\n",
      "Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant , and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me , I suppose that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand . \"\r\n",
      "On the other hand , the dialogues are simple and shorter :\r\n",
      "\" Now look here , \" he said , \" the question being whether you 're to be let to live . You know\r\n",
      "What is a file ? \"\r\n",
      "\" Yes , sir . \"\r\n",
      "\" And you know what wittles are ? \"\r\n",
      "\" Yes , sir . \"\r\n",
      "Moreover , the vocabulary used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters say .\r\n",
      "Pip uses a rich vocabulary , using a lot of mental verbs and abstract concepts that are usually inspired by concrete things .\r\n",
      "The marsh pointed out in the first chapter is a good example .\r\n",
      "Regardless , the dialogues are written exactly as they were said .\r\n",
      "The thief said \" Who d'ye with ? \"\r\n",
      "This is written as it is said , making it more realistic .\r\n",
      "Notwithstanding , the way this novel is narrated is the protagonist .\r\n",
      "The events are narrated in a mysterious way , telling us what happened in a realistic story - line without flashbacks .\r\n",
      "The story is narrated as it happens .\r\n",
      "The second chapter makes reference to the first and reveals something about the thief .\r\n",
      "Also , the slow rhythm is adequate .\r\n",
      "The narrator reveals not so much about him or the other characters , but he writes about the essential things we should know through the text .\r\n",
      "The thief disappears , but the first chapter ending makes us feel curious about their next meeting .\r\n",
      "Therefore , I do not know how the story will end .\r\n",
      "Too much mystery and just a few facts can be read in these chapters .\r\n",
      "All I know is that this story will not have a happy ending .\r\n",
      "The thief will probably take Pip to an unwanted adventure that will make him grow up faster .\r\n",
      "I would like to read a story where Pip ends as he starts , at the graveyard .\r\n",
      "Like another brick in the wall , another tombstone in the graveyard .\r\n",
      "I would like to read a story without a tale , just a regular man who died while he was learning to live .\r\n",
      "Obviously , this would be difficult as the narrator 's voice clearly comes from a person who lives while he is writing .\r\n",
      "This is obvious when he makes reference to the fact that photography did not exist when he was a kid .\r\n",
      "Consequently , reading these chapters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to tell what is going to happen or , what is more , what the author is trying to transmit .\r\n",
      "If the story has a happy ending , then the central theme could be getting over adversities ; if not , it is a sad story .\r\n",
      "Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .\r\n",
      "She has been waiting so long for this day to come .\r\n",
      "It was the day when she was going to meet her biological mother .\r\n",
      "She knew she had been adopted since she was 7 years old because her parents told her about it .\r\n",
      "She did not feel bad about it because she loves her parents very much and she feels loved by them .\r\n",
      "After her 18th birthday , Anna felt a sudden necessity of knowing what happened to her bilogical mother and why she gave Anna away .\r\n",
      "After finding the adoption papers she contacted the adoption agency .\r\n",
      "She convinced the lady at the agency to give her the name of the biological mother of \" her little sister who had a disease and needed to know if her bilogical mother would be a match for a kidney transplant \" .\r\n",
      "Even though it was illegal , the lady gave her the name and the contact phone number of Sara Fielding , her biological mother .\r\n",
      "A month passed by before she had the courage to dial that number .\r\n",
      "She hesitated several times because she was afraid of her mother 's rejection .\r\n",
      "After a few seconds , a woman picked up the phone .\r\n",
      "At the beginning , Anna did not say anything , she could not utter any sound .\r\n",
      "But then she said \" Hello , my name is Anna and I think you are my mother \" .\r\n",
      "After another few seconds of silence , Anna heard her mother crying and asking lots of questions .\r\n",
      "They agreed to meet the next day in the park .\r\n",
      "She was going to have so many answers to so many questions .\r\n",
      "Anna will be able to finally close an important chapter in her life and that is why she knew that it was going to be a very special day .\r\n",
      "It was the most exciting day of my life .\r\n",
      "Last summer I went on holiday in Sardegna , Italy , with my family .\r\n",
      "On the first day I was very angry because my parents did n't take with us Ilaria , my best friend .\r\n",
      "But I changed my mind when I heard on the radio that Felix Sandman , a Swedish singer , was on holiday in Sardegna near my hotel !\r\n",
      "I love him and my dream was to meet him , but I knew it was impossible and my parents did n't want to drive me to his hotel , so I was quite sad .\r\n",
      "Unexpectedly , on the third day , while I was swimming in the sea , I saw some people in the distance and some cameras , but at that moment I thought they were making a video .\r\n",
      "Then , I realised the boy at the centre was n't a simple boy , he was Felix !\r\n",
      "So I went toward the crowd and when he saw me he smiled .\r\n",
      "I was really excited !\r\n",
      "Then I went to him and he took a photo with me .\r\n",
      "He stayed there for a few hours and I spent the best day of my life , asking him some questions and singing his songs .\r\n",
      "When he left I was sad but also really happy .\r\n",
      "This was certainly the most exciting day of my life .\r\n",

      "One of my favourite restaurants that I am always hungry for is L'Albero Pizzeria , located in the Huelin neighbourhood .\r\n",
      "As you enter the restaurant , you know the pizza is going to be good .\r\n",
      "The walls are covered with trophies and photographs for the world 's best pizza .\r\n",
      "The space is family friendly , a perfect place to celebrate a birthday or meet friends .\r\n",
      "My only complaint is that there are too many delicious choices on the menu . It is often difficult deciding what to order .\r\n",
      "So far I have never been disappointed .\r\n",
      "To start , you must try the Rose Wind Salad . It 's a fresh , flavourful salad that is served in a bowl made of pizza crust .\r\n",

      "The best places for young people in Dublin\r\n",
      "This report looks at the best places to visit in Dublin for young people from different countries .\r\n",
      "It is based on a survey of young people from Whitehall College as well as my own opinion as a permanent resident in the area .\r\n",
      "It seems that the majority of those surveyed are of the opinion that the best place to visit for young people would be Temple Bar .\r\n",
      "It offers a wide variety of activities like museums , a cinema , a very large green garden and many pubs to choose from .\r\n",
      "The Johnnie Fox Pub was highly recommended . It offers an opportunity to listen to traditional music , watch dancers perform and enjoy a nice meal in one place .\r\n",
      "The Odeon cinema offers a multiple choice of movies in 2D and 3D and a discount for students on Wednesdays .\r\n",
      "The Dublin Wax Museum was suggested by many students .\r\n",
      "Several people said that the National Botanic Garden is the best place for students to meet and spend time outdoors .\r\n",
      "On the whole there are activities to take part in and many places to visit depending on students ' preferences and finances available to them .\r\n",
      "It is true that people everywhere like watching sports .\r\n",
      "Sports start being admired by youth and can imprint a model of behavior on the young 's minds .\r\n",
      "In this essay both sides of the position stated above will be analyzed before my own perspective is provided .\r\n",
      "From one point of view , top athletes are good models to emulate for several reasons .\r\n",
      "Firstly , watching the success of such athletes , teenagers start to desire to be like their idols and to follow professional sports .\r\n",
      "This means they will want to play sports , which is essential for their health .\r\n",
      "Secondly , doing sports also teaches priceless life lessons , such as discipline and dealing with success and failure .\r\n",
      "The importance of working hard to achieve goals and practicing regularly to become good at something is also demonstrated by professional sportsmen .\r\n",
      "This is a good example for youngsters to follow .\r\n",
      "From another perspective , sometimes professional athletes are not good role models .\r\n",
      "Firstly , sport has become a business .\r\n",
      "Many sports stars are only concerned about money and fame .\r\n",
      "This can lead adolescents to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play well and having the fun of the game or the competition .\r\n",
      "Secondly , there are those athletes who behave disgustingly .\r\n",
      "For example , some take drugs or cheat in order to win at any cost .\r\n",
      "It goes without saying that this kind of behavior sends a wrong message to the young .\r\n",
      "In conclusion , there are a number of advantages and disadvantages with regard to professional sportsmen as good role models for young people .\r\n",
      "On balance , I am inclined to believe that professional athletes can be excellent role models for the youth , as long as they represent the positive aspects of playing sports .\r\n",
      "Dickens and the Bronte sisters use the same style : realistic style .\r\n",
      "They are influenced by the surroundings in which they live : Dickens the city of London while the Bronte sisters the natural landscape of Yorkshire .\r\n",
      "Dickens and Charlotte Bronte often use the first person narrator or the point of view of the protagonist of the story .\r\n",
      "Their realism is different : in fact Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism in which he mixes pathos and comedy , like characters that tend to be caricatures of the vices and virtues he wishes to portray , while the Bronte sisters use realistic styles laced with Romantic and Gothic elements , like Byronic male heroes and female protagonists that are psychologically complex .\r\n",
      "The graph illustrates the four different sources of consumption of fish and other meat in European countries from 1979 to 2004 .\r\n",
      "Of the given source , the overall fish and meat consumption ranked from nearly 60 grams per person per week to roughly 230 grams per person per week .\r\n",
      "From the 4 source ate , 3 of them remained a steady decline with the exception of chicken consumption which had risen over the 25 year period .\r\n",
      "Only fish consumption showed little change during the period , beginning and ending at approximately the same level of 52 grams per person per week .\r\n",
      "Both lamb consumption and the category labelled beef had a decline trend between 1979 and 2004 , although they maintained a decrease overall , with lamb consumption falling from a peak of 150 grams per person per week in 1979 down to just over 50 grams per person per week in 2004 and beef consumption falling from around 230 grams per person per week down to just over 120 grams per person per week .\r\n",
      "Chicken consumption was the only source of meat consumption which elaborated stable climbing from 150 grams per person per week to the highest consumption of 250 per person per week .\r\n",
      "Overall , it is evident from the graph that some sectors declined , others rose and one remained steady consumption over the 25 year span .\r\n",

      "My name is Dmitry Lavrov .\r\n",
      "I 'm a postdoc in the Russian Cancer Research Center .\r\n",
      "Our lab works along with Alexis Hervieux on his study of arpin .\r\n",
      "Recently he has visited Moscow and while we 've been having a conversation I 've mentioned that I was looking for the opportunity to work in a postdoc position abroad .\r\n",
      "And since my great interest is to develop my skills in microscopy and digital image analysis while working in the field of cell biology , Alexis told me to try and contact you .\r\n",
      "Our conversation with Alexis and your own publications - all support the suggestion that working in your lab apparently will provide valuable opportunities to master methodological and research skills .\r\n",
      "Not to mention participation in pioneering studies .\r\n",
      "My own work is dedicated to the study of changes in cell - cell contacts and in actin cytoskeleton that take place during neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells .\r\n",
      "Earlier I had a publication in PLoS One with description of dissimilarities in organization and regulation of adherence junctions associated with different types of actin bundles in normal and transformed epithelial cells .\r\n",
      "Thereafter I studied accumulation of various actin - binding proteins and actin isoforms within adherence junction in normal and transformed cells .\r\n",
      "On the coarse of this investigation I have obtained some promising results which I 'm going to report on the FEBS - EMBO conference which will take place in Paris in the beginning of September .\r\n",
      "Also , I 'm preparing materials for the next publication .\r\n",
      "Yours respectfully ,\r\n",

      "I am writing about an important historical place which is my favourite one . I am referring to Lugo city .\r\n",
      "I visited Lugo last summer and I enjoyed myself very much .\r\n",
      "I walked through the old city , through its beautiful squares and parks and I visited its numerous churches , including the cathedral .\r\n",
      "There are a lot of places in Lugo worth visiting .\r\n",
      "For example , you can walk around the Roman Wall , which has been declared a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000 because it is the only Roman Wall in the world that is complete .\r\n",
      "I think that Lugo is very beautiful .\r\n",
      "There are a lot of shops where tourists and visitors can buy souvenirs and there are many restaurants where you can eat delicious and typical dishes , for example , octopus .\r\n",
      "In Lugo , many traditional parties and festivals take place .\r\n",
      "Among the most important , I can mention San Froilán and Arde Lucus .\r\n",
      "From 4th to 12th October , Lugo holds its San Froilán Fiestas .\r\n",
      "San Froilán is a festival of National Tourist Interest .\r\n",
      "This festival is dedicated to the city 's patron saint , and it shows traditional Galician costumes and folklore .\r\n",
      "Another important festival in Lugo is Arde Lucus .\r\n",
      "It is celebrated in June .\r\n",
      "During this festivity , Lugo becomes a 3rd century town once again , so you can see Roman circus , Celtic weddings , artisan markets , many musical events taking place and local people and visitors get into period costumes , such as gladiators and Roman Emperors .\r\n",
      "I recommend you visit Lugo in June because Arde Lucus is celebrated .\r\n",
      "You can enjoy traditional Roman customs and Roman life in Arde Lucus .\r\n",
      "Lugo is an incredible city and it is important in the history of my country because it is full of historical places , festivals which show and perform precise periods of the history of Spain , such as the Celtic period and the Roman period .\r\n",
      "The bigger the city , the bigger the problem .\r\n",
      "The town is the 2nd largest urban agglomeration in the country , producing daily large amounts of waste . \"\r\n",
      "City X \" has no specific waste disposal plan , but a federal law establishes a due term until 1st July .\r\n",
      "Despite this , there are a few plans to increase the green areas and revitalize the town .\r\n",
      "The city is thriving on implementing new measures to achieve the Council 's goals .\r\n",
      "The analysis will consist of evaluating the Council 's eco - friendly proposals .\r\n",
      "In accord with the aforementioned , the amount of garbage produced during the years 2007 and 2010 more than doubled , 86% of it discarded inadequately .\r\n",
      "This is due to the low effect of the \" Recycling Worms \" program over the disposal problem . \"\r\n",
      "City X \" incinerates hospital residue , in accordance with legal requirements , and sends 7% of the garbage production to recycling factories .\r\n",
      "The recycling factories have a joint venture with the municipality to sort waste , and show a result 20% better than last year .\r\n",
      "The program represents 2% of the employment in the city , but it needs to expand .\r\n",
      "The city has many projects such as the \" Keep it clean , keep it beautiful \" , whose goal is to promote proper disposal in public areas .\r\n",
      "Another important one is the \" Let 's make it green \" , responsible for increasing the green areas within the city by 150% during the last two years , consisting of a combination of public and private investment in reforestation of rural and communal areas .\r\n",
      "A later crucial activity is the \" Green Communities \" , currently carrying 38% of the total amount of consumed vegetables in the metropolitan area .\r\n",
      "A municipal waste policy that integrates the private and public sectors and the community is required to solve the current problem .\r\n",
      "The city needs a joint venture to support a functional and sustainable commerce of recycled rubbish .\r\n",
      "The increase of green areas represents a significant improvement in the quality of life according to the USED report of 2012 and also fits in 16 of 20 requirements of a city in the future .\r\n",
      "Most of the \" Recycling Worms \" problem is caused by this lack of training , which can be resolved by training offered in the surrounding universities .\r\n",
      "It is a good idea to take a year off between leaving school and starting university , because you can have lots of new experiences .\r\n",
      "For example , you can travel to new places .\r\n",
      "Another idea is that you can work , you can find a job and earn money before you start university .\r\n",
      "Moreover , sometimes people are tired when they finish school because of the exams so they need to have some time to relax .\r\n",
      "You can travel to different countries if you have time . I would like to go to Asia , Thailand or China .\r\n",
      "But you need to earn money if you want to travel , so you can first work and then travel .\r\n",
      "You can find work as a waiter or in a shop .\r\n",
      "However , some people think you should go to university immediately after you finish school because if you do n't , you forget what you have learned in school .\r\n",
      "But I think you can also learn if you travel or if you work , so that is a good idea also , especially if you find a job related to what you want to study .\r\n",
      "We live in a time when everything changes quickly .\r\n",
      "A technological development makes people believe that in the future everything will look like in science - fiction movies .\r\n",
      "We 'll be surrounded by machines and robots .\r\n",
      "We 'll have a possibility to choose which planet we want to live on .\r\n",
      "And what about houses ?\r\n",
      "Will people 's homes be different or still the same ?\r\n",
      "Imagining the future , I see everything different .\r\n",
      "The avant - garde and futuristic projects of houses will be the most desirable .\r\n",
      "The houses will have , for example , the shape of a sphere or igloo .\r\n",
      "Some of them might be turned upside down .\r\n",
      "Sometimes they will be some kind of modern art and it will be hard to describe a shape .\r\n",
      "And what about the interior ?\r\n",
      "In our service there will be more machines and robots with artificial intelligence .\r\n",
      "They will practically do everything : clean , cook , remind us of what we have to do and also speak with us like an average human .\r\n",
      "In practice there will be no normal furniture , just machines waiting for a command .\r\n",
      "Everything will be artificial and uncozy .\r\n",
      "That 's how I see the home of the future .\r\n",
      "Glad to hear that you 've been invited to attend the last round of interviews next month !\r\n",
      "I really hope to work with you someday !\r\n",
      "To make sure you get the position successfully , here is some useful advice and information you might want to know .\r\n",
      "At the interview , leaving interviewers a good impression is of great importance . Here are some tips on how to do it .\r\n",
      "First , dress as properly as possible .\r\n",
      "Businesslike suits and ties fit in well with formal occasions .\r\n",
      "Suitable dressing comes across as effective and reliable .\r\n",
      "Second , being punctual .\r\n",
      "Interviewers have to cope with a tight schedule everyday so they are n't willing to spare one more minute to wait for a candidate who 's late somehow .\r\n",
      "Third , be prepared .\r\n",
      "As the old saying goes , well prepared is half done .\r\n",
      "You 're expected to know something about our company , ask proper questions and communicate effectively with interviewers .\r\n",
      "If you can learn as much knowledge about our company as you can up front , you really stand a chance in the interview .\r\n",
      "Since you 've applied for the sales assistant in the sales department , the sales manager will be interviewing you .\r\n",
      "He started out his career as an accountant , but he was fed up with dealing with numbers all day long .\r\n",
      "Plus , he 's willing to communicate with others and take on new challenges so he transferred to the sales department two years ago .\r\n",
      "He got promoted very quickly because he always brought forth new ideas and facilitated the reform and development in the department .\r\n",
      "In his eyes , what counts most is the track record and the capabilities shown in previous working experiences , so he might ask you some questions like what you achieved and how you felt about your last job .\r\n",
      "I hope what I mentioned above will be of some help to you .\r\n",
      "Looking forward to hearing from you soon .\r\n",
      "Lots of Love ,\r\n",
      "Iris\r\n",
      "Dear Sir or Madam\r\n",
      "I am writing in connection with your advertisement regarding jobs at summer camps all over the USA .\r\n",
      "Since my mother tongue is English , albeit of the British variety , and I am generally deemed cheerful , energetic and hard working , I believe I am a suitable candidate for the aforementioned position .\r\n",
      "Additionally , as a teenager , I supervised a Wolf Cub pack of eight to twelve - year - olds , and often organised sports and evening activities for them , such as treasure hunts and paper chases .\r\n",
      "Moreover , when I was an undergraduate , I spent my summers working in the college canteen as a kitchen help , and progressed to the position of cook .\r\n",
      "Because of all the above points , I think I am a suitable person for the job .\r\n",
      "Yours faithfully\r\n",
      "I find it quite difficult to find an area of improvement given Andres 's outstanding overall performance .\r\n",
      "Yet , oftentimes , being overly respectful may play against him and although he has gained the respect of all the people he has worked with , some of them suggested he should build up his self - confidence , rather than end up attempting to cover everyone 's back and taking ownership of other people 's mistakes .\r\n",
      "If I had my own language school I would first bear in mind a main goal : raising public awareness of my language school and the services it will provide .\r\n",
      "Then I would start gathering some information about the market , that is to say , social trends , population statistics such as age , gender and family type , potential customers and competitors as well .\r\n",
      "By doing so , I would be able not only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my product and to improve my performance but also to identify customers ' needs .\r\n",
      "After that , I would make a list of target markets and device some strategies to attract them .\r\n",
      "For instance , if my goal was to increase young people 's awareness , some strategies could be to increase online social media presence by posting regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Facebook or to offer discounts for siblings .\r\n",
      "Instead , if my goal was to increase adult 's awareness , advertising in local newspapers or offering intensive courses could prove successful .\r\n",
      "However , if the target markets were both young people and adults , offering discounts for family groups could be a better choice .\r\n",
      "The last step would be to recruit a staff of professional , experienced and qualified teachers and to set an attractive and reasonable price for the services I would provide .\r\n",
      "Last but not least , I would test ideas and approaches on customers and staff to make sure that my marketing plan succeeded .\r\n",
      "And you ?\r\n",
      "Have you ever thought about how you can promote your language courses , for example ?\r\n",
      "I challenge you to think about it and try it .\r\n",
      "According to recent research , there is no doubt that natural gas drilling rigs , natural gas pipelines and underground gas storage contribute to increasing wealth of the local communities .\r\n",
      "People who live in the areas of natural gas infrastructure earn from a few to several percent more than those who live in other regions where such an infrastructure does n't exist .\r\n",
      "Another advantage is that developing the natural gas industry equals new jobs which are profitable for people living in whereabouts .\r\n",
      "Exploration and extraction of the shale gas will create lots of new jobs in very different branches connected with the gas industry , for instance in exploration , mining , production and distribution of shale gas .\r\n",
      "We can not ignore the fact that companies which cooperate with this infrastructure will also create vacant jobs .\r\n",
      "Even if companies hire engineers and specialists mostly from abroad , there will be upgrowth in the number of job positions in gastronomy and hospitality zones as they need to eat and sleep somewhere .\r\n",
      "According to the dynamics of development of the natural gas infrastructure , there will be constant development in the gastronomy and hospitality sectors as well .\r\n",
      "The Kosciuszko Institute conducted research which shows that Poland can benefit from extracting and developing the infrastructure of shale gas\r\n",
      "Greece is an amazing country that a lot of people visit annually .\r\n",
      "When planning their vacation , a lot of tourists are faced with the dilemma of which places to visit .\r\n",
      "Choosing where to go in Greece can be hard as there are so many choices .\r\n",
      "There are some travel destinations that definitely stand out , such as Santorini .\r\n",
      "Sandy beaches , crystal clear waters and the friendly locals are not the only things that set it apart from other islands .\r\n",
      "Santorini also has a volcano which is a spectacular sight , even though exploring it can be dangerous !\r\n",
      "Another place worth visiting in Greece is Athens .\r\n",
      "Believe it or not , Athens is one of the most beautiful cities in the world .\r\n",
      "The Parthenon , the Acropolis Museum and the district of Monastiraki are just a few of the things that people love about Athens .\r\n",
      "Last but not least , Crete is one of the most spectacular islands in Greece .\r\n",
      "Other than having beautiful sandy beaches and being the largest island in Greece , people can visit the water sports parks there , which are extremely fun !\r\n",
      "Summing up , Greece is a beautiful country worth visiting , although choosing where to go can be hard .\r\n",
      "The question is whether it 's better to prepare for a long time before the exam or a few days are going to be enough .\r\n",
      "In my personal experience , I believe that it 's much better to prepare for a long time before any exam you may face in your life .\r\n",
      "It 's quite important to be organized to get the highest score you can get on your exam .\r\n",
      "For example , one year ago , I had my final surgery exam .\r\n",
      "I had set up a plan to study all the books we had to go through for the exam plus review them twice .\r\n",
      "The plan required my commitment for around 12 hours of daily study for almost 3 months .\r\n",
      "Because of the hard work and perfect discipline , I was able to get a very high score in my surgery finals .\r\n",
      "If I had n't had such an organized plan , I would never have gotten such a perfect score .\r\n",
      "Another thing to add is not being stressed before the exam night .\r\n",
      "It 's quite normal to have this basic feeling of being stressed and nervous when exams are approaching .\r\n",
      "What is not normal at all is having anxiety due to the plethora of studies you haven't finished and are included in your exam .\r\n",
      "For example , I once had a chemistry exam in high school and I was ignorant enough to neglect my studies thinking that I still had enough time to ace my exam .\r\n",
      "Two days before my exam , I realized that I had run out of time .\r\n",
      "I had insomnia the night of my exam , it was n't enough that I was n't well prepared but also my nerves got torn out and that affected my scores tremendously .\r\n",
      "Ever since I do everything in its due time in order not to be overly stressed and get low scores .\r\n",
      "Moreover , if I aim at getting high scores , I assert that memorizing the details is important .\r\n",
      "If you do n't start studying before the exam at an appropriate time , you will only have enough time to know the broad lines of the subject , but this will never help you soak the details and understand the concepts lying behind every single word .\r\n",
      "That will help you a lot even if you do n't get the chance to revise everything before your exam .\r\n",
      "I can recall that time when I was quite ill before my Anatomy exam ; I could only go through the main titles of each branch without going through the details .\r\n",
      "In the exam , I had that question where it required describing a concept ; amazingly , I was able to do it perfectly .\r\n",
      "Since I had practiced a lot and memorized that concept many times before , I was able to remember it .\r\n",
      "It was just flooding without so much effort .\r\n",
      "So , for sure having enough time to memorize and practice what you learn is going to help you a lot in your exam .\r\n",
      "In sum , I believe that setting a schedule to have a long time preparation plan is much better than having only a few days to get prepared . If you want to get high scores and perform greatly , you should start studying from day one if possible .\r\n",
      "Do n't you think you are worth getting the highest score one could aim at ?\r\n",
      "In my opinion , nuclear energy has the best chance to replace fossil fuels .\r\n",
      "Firstly , nuclear energy is n't bad for the environment .\r\n",
      "Carbon dioxide emissions are very small .\r\n",
      "The biggest threat is the explosion .\r\n",
      "However , technology is evolving and nuclear power plants are getting safer .\r\n",
      "Secondly , nuclear power plants are already very popular and this type of energy is the closest to replacing fossil fuels .\r\n",
      "Energy which we get from the sun and wind is still only a few percent of world energy production .\r\n",
      "Thirdly , only the construction of a nuclear power plant is expensive .\r\n",
      "When we have a plant , making energy from it is very cheap .\r\n",

      "Last time you asked me for some information about opening a saving account in the UK . I 've done some research to find out the best savings account for you .\r\n",
      "Below you can find a few suggestions .\r\n",
      "The Phone Bank might give you quite a good offer .\r\n",
      "Firstly , the rate of interest is 3.1% , which is quite good .\r\n",
      "Additionally , if you open a saving account in that bank , you will get a diary as a gift .\r\n",
      "And you do not need to pay any annual charges for having a credit card .\r\n",

      "You also get a gift as a new account holder , a full set of saucepans ( do you really need it ? ) .\r\n",
      "All in all , I would recommend you to open your first serving account in the Phone Bank , since the rate of interest is higher and you do n't need to pay any annual charges .\r\n",
      "And doing operations by phone is actually very easy and they always give you a great opportunity to improve your English .\r\n",

      "My parents would take me to a gentle slope with my brother and leave us there for a couple of hours to try skiing on our own .\r\n",

      "My brother showed a natural talent for the sport , but I felt quite uncomfortable and scared .\r\n",

      "Nowadays I have a lot of fun skiing because it gives me the opportunity to be in a wonderful natural environment .\r\n",
      "Skiing is a great sport , but I would recommend starting as a child , taking a few lessons with an experienced instructor and using the right equipment .\r\n",
      "After six years of rigorous high school subjects and past experiences , I have no doubt that the preferences I 've selected above are not accidental .\r\n",
      "I am extremely interested in gaining experience in the business field .\r\n",

      "After I heard about the Czech Government Scholarship , I decided to do some research on the Czech Republic before taking any step in applying .\r\n",

      "Czech universities provide high standards of education , internationally recognized degrees , modern campuses with outstanding facilities , safe and affordable education , warm and friendly environment and cultural diversity .\r\n",
      "I believe that I will have the opportunity to experience both modernity and tradition in one of the safest and most stable countries in Europe .\r\n",
      "Above all , the high quality of education will make me ready for the future .\r\n",
      "Another major reason why I am motivated to study in the Czech Republic is lack of finance .\r\n",
      "Also , education in Nigeria is now a joke as teachers and lecturers go on strike frequently , and learning in some parts of Nigeria is not safe !\r\n",

      "Dogs are really not that hard to take care of , bathing and grooming do n't need to be done every day , they just need to be fed and walked regularly .\r\n",
      "These pets need a few walks a day , which could also be good for their owners who are spending all day at work or in school and need some physical activity .\r\n",
      "So having a dog could also remind them to live a healthier life .\r\n",
      "In conclusion , dogs make really great pets .\r\n",
      "Not only do they protect you from anything that could do you any harm , but their amazing personality and the love they show to you makes you feel so warm and wonderful on the inside .\r\n",
      "So if someone really loves their pet , they would find time to pay a lot of attention to them , because they truly are man 's best friend .\r\n",

      "Although it made me feel exhausted , I found it extremely entertaining .\r\n",
      "Luckily , I was fit enough to finish the exercise without having any problem , however , you may need to train a little bit more before embarking on this activity .\r\n",
      "Rock climbing was another of the challenges I had to face .\r\n",
      "Despite the fact that it turned out to be harder than I had expected , I managed to reach the summit .\r\n",

      "One of the last activities offered by the centre was diving .\r\n",
      "I felt so overwhelmed that I had to give up , so if you do n't want to miss out on this great opportunity too , trust your trainers , since they are highly qualified .\r\n",

      "One of them is the triathlon , which is my favourite sport .\r\n",
      "It consists of a mixture of three different sports , swimming , cycling and jogging and as a result it can be extremely demanding .\r\n",

      "But that is not the only reason to take a year off .\r\n",
      "Most people think that this year is to travel to other countries and spend all your time at parties , but this is not true . You can travel to develop your culture and do volunteer work , so you can become a better person .\r\n",
      "On the other hand , many teens who take a year off end up spending it in the wrong way .\r\n",
      "For example , things might not have gone as they had expected for multiple reasons such as not having enough money or not getting a job .\r\n",

      "When you visit different places , you get to see different environments , cultures , people and even different languages .\r\n",
      "Travelling helps you to develop as a person in many ways .\r\n",
      "For example , if you learn another language different from your own , even if it is just a few basic sentences , you can communicate with people from different regions and you improve your confidence .\r\n",
      "Travelling also helps to see the way in which other people live , to see that your way of living is not the only one that exists .\r\n",
      "This can help you to understand that not everyone has access to many things you do have access to too , and to realise that perhaps you should appreciate these things , such as smartphones , computers , cars or even fresh water , which is a basic resource and we tend to take for granted that everyone can have some water to drink even though this is not true .\r\n",
      "Besides , when we travel to different places we see there are many different cultures that differ greatly from our own culture , and we see how different from one another humans are .\r\n",

      "I also find that Analytical Chemistry and Environmental Chemistry are interesting fields of Chemistry because of their numerous applications .\r\n",

      "Is there no future for public transport ?\r\n",
      "The number of cars is growing rapidly , however public transport is still in use .\r\n",
      "Especially in big cities , where there are traffic jams , public transport is becoming more and more popular again .\r\n",
      "In some cities it 's even forbidden to drive through the city center without some special permission , so there is no other solution than to use public transport .\r\n",
      "But what is more convenient - your own car or public transport ?\r\n",
      "Well it depends .... When you travel in your own car , you are independent .\r\n",
      "You do not have to worry about the schedule - you are a driver so it 's your decision whenever you want to go or stay longer in some place .\r\n",
      "You can listen to your favorite music or radio .\r\n",
      "You are the boss .\r\n",
      "However , as a driver you always have to be careful and watch out on the route .\r\n",
      "If you want to travel from one place to another to see different places , your own car is the best solution .\r\n",
      "It allows you to see much more at your own pace .\r\n",
      "But think about the costs .\r\n",
      "Think how much you pay for petrol nowadays .\r\n",
      "Consider as well how many days you have for vacation .\r\n",
      "Maybe cheap airlines are better ?\r\n",
      "Being back in our everyday life .\r\n",
      "Most of us live in big cities and face problems with the traffic .\r\n",
      "What if we use public transport to get to work ?\r\n",
      "Well , then you do n't have to worry about the parking space and you can read more books on the way to work .\r\n",
      "Simply , you can use the way to work as an additional time for yourself .\r\n",
      "What else ?\r\n",
      "After work you can go for a drink with your colleagues !\r\n",
      "And if ecology is important for you , just think about pollution .\r\n",
      "Let 's reflect once again : is there a future for public transport ?\r\n",
      "In my opinion : Yes , there is !\r\n",
      "Is travelling by car more convenient ?\r\n",
      "Well , it depends !\r\n",
      "Why use the first narration ?\r\n",
      "The first narration can attract readers ' attention at the beginning of the friction and makes the readers get into the thoughts of the madman easily .\r\n",
      "We ca n't understand what others usually think , but in this friction , the author invited us to know what was inside the madman 's mind .\r\n",
      "Feeling that the main character is talking to us , as if we were all involved in this case , the whole thing seemed like it really happened .\r\n",
      "Facing murder directly makes the horror penetrate into our hearts .\r\n",
      "How does the author create a word of horror for his readers ?\r\n",
      "The author created the horrible atmosphere by describing the scene , the disordered mind and the sound of heartbeats .\r\n",
      "First , the scene that described the murder makes readers ca n't help themselves emerging from the images in their mind .\r\n",
      "Just like the madman 's plan was happening right in front of us .\r\n",
      "Then comes the sound , the heartbeat .\r\n",
      "In my opinion , heartbeat is the element that pushes the whole story to the climax .\r\n",
      "Every time the sound of heartbeats started arousing , something ensued .\r\n",
      "The first time , when the madman heard the heartbeat of the old man , he was going to kill the old man , and he did it .\r\n",
      "The second time when the madman heard the heartbeat , he became impatient , scared , excited and insane . In the end , he confessed that he killed the man and dismembered the corpse .\r\n",
      "At the same time , the heartbeat also dragged the readers nervous and anxious .\r\n",
      "Finally , I think the way the author wanted to express the disordered mind of the madman is his intonation .\r\n",
      "The whole story except the end of the friction he confessed to the crime , the madman used the intonation that is extremely calm and steady , to tell the readers the process of the cruel thing that he had done .\r\n",
      "The sharp contract for the calm and the cruelty leaves us a strong impression that the main character was totally insane and crazy .\r\n",
      "Shivering inside our hearts , the horror increases .\r\n",
      "\" Let 's go to the forest to see the variety of animals which are found there \" , Max told his friends one sunny afternoon .\r\n",
      "When all was set , they started their trip to the forest .\r\n",
      "When they arrived there , they started to look around trying to find different types of animals such as birds , rabbits and deer .\r\n",
      "Max and his friends took a walk under the trees when , across the river , they saw something that looked like an animal lying on the grass . \" What 's that ? \" , Max said aloud .\r\n",
      "They ran quickly , crossed the river and they reached the place where the animal was . \" It 's a deer ! , its leg is in a trap \" , Max 's friend shouted .\r\n",
      "When they saw the animal , they could see that it was suffering , so they decided to free the deer .\r\n",
      "By this decision , Max took courage to open the trap , but the deer did n't move because its leg was injured .\r\n",
      "One of Max 's friends brought water from the river to give to the deer .\r\n",
      "Max cut a piece of his T - shirt to cure the animal .\r\n",
      "Afterwards , the animal was better and it walked away slowly .\r\n",
      "When the day finished , Max and his friends returned home feeling happy because they had saved the animal 's life . \" What an amazing day ! \" , Max whispered to himself as he got into bed that night .\r\n",
      "The question is : whether it is possible to be famous without journalists ?\r\n",
      "Probably not , but there are many people in show - business or political life , who are ready to do everything to save their private life .\r\n",
      "Generally , people may be famous for two reasons : because of their job or because of their scandalising private life .\r\n",
      "If you decide to become famous because of your scandalising private life , it would be silly to complain about tiring paparazzi .\r\n",
      "There is a rule , probably one of the most important in public life , that says more or less : ' It is not important what are they talking about you , it is important they are talking about you ' .\r\n",
      "Most celebrities follow this rule , as it is just what they are living for .\r\n",
      "That is why they are often able to sell information about their private life .\r\n",
      "The real problem starts when journalists injure not the celebrity , but their friends or family .\r\n",
      "Paparazzi are cruel in contact with famous people 's children , which may have a negative influence on their emotional development .\r\n",
      "How about those who do not want to be popular because of scandals ?\r\n",
      "In most cases they are just doing their job as well as they can , leading their boring life .\r\n",
      "And when finally the paparazzi notice that there is nothing interesting in their life , they just leave them alone .\r\n",
      "Summarizing , I do believe that adult people are responsible enough to make a decision , if they want to share the most important part of their life with journalists .\r\n",
      "And I hope they understand that their duty is to save their relatives .\r\n",

      "I went to dinner with 6 more friends in order to have fun and eat good Mexican food after a stressful week .\r\n",
      "In my opinion , the food was good but the prices were too expensive considering the quantity served and the messy service .\r\n",
      "We faced continuous problems with the order such as : dishes from another table served for us by mistake , the drinks were served with a considerable delay and the bill was shown even without asking ( just because we finished the dinner but our drinks were still on the table ) .\r\n",
      "For my luck ( or not ) , I met a friend of mine the day after that told me that she had dinner at \" Las Ficheras \" before and in her opinion , as a Mexican , that restaurant was terrible .\r\n",

      "The Guardian 's article \" World 's climate about to enter ' uncharted territory ' as it passes 1C of warming \" , published on the 9th November 2015 , describes the problems of global warming .\r\n",
      "Referring to scientists at the British Met Office , 2015 is going to be the year when the milestone of 1C warming will be broken - caused by global warming - which will lead to unknown consequences in the future .\r\n",
      "The World Meteorological Organization made known publicly that 2015 has been the hottest year on record as well as it has caused more carbon dioxide on average by burning fossil fuels .\r\n",
      "These problems just announced recently will be issues to talk about at the UN summit in Paris in three weeks .\r\n",
      "Then , world leaders will be negotiating about cutting the increased carbon emissions coupled with the El Niáo climate phenomenon .\r\n",
      "Stephen Belcher , director of the Met Office 's Hadley Centre , claims that humanity is to blame for climate changes such as the rise of temperature or the catastrophe expected by scientists when global warming rises beyond 2C. This opinion is also represented by the British Secretary of energy and climate change , Amber Rudd , who considers climate change to be one of the greatest problems in nowadays 's politics due to its consequences on the economy , global security and the fight against poverty .\r\n",
      "She stands up for a global deal confirmed at the UN summit by the leading states and therefore these climate targets should be a role - model for other countries .\r\n",
      "Furthermore , climate scientist Ed Hawkins expects a continuation of global warming , clarifying this statement with the example of Central England , which has warmed 20% more than the global average .\r\n",
      "Global warming in general leads to more natural disasters such as flooding , heatwaves , water stress and loss of harvests .\r\n",
      "Facing these consequences , a 4C warming would be even more damaging according to Belcher .\r\n",
      "Despite the result of a NASA study pointing out that there would have been an ice mass grown in Antarctica from 2003 - 2008 , there is only a small chance of 5 - 10% that this prognosis will come true according to Prof Andrew Shepherd , University of Leeds , as the study has already been proven wrong by 57 other studies .\r\n",
      "Although the NASA study shows a different result , the majority of scientists see global warming as a dangerous threat for this planet in terms of living conditions , environment and economy as well as an issue of the UN summit in Paris .\r\n",
      "The problem lies in the outdated framework in which the IWC operates .\r\n",
      "Fifteen whaling nations formed the IWC after whale populations collapsed .\r\n",
      "The organisation was initially set up to conserve whales only to the extent that they could continue to be used by humans .\r\n",
      "The importance of World Heritage properties transcends national boundaries .\r\n",
      "Their qualities are extraordinary so that no matter which country they are found in , and who experiences them , they evoke a sense of wonder and admiration .\r\n",
      "To be included on the World Heritage List , properties must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one of ten selection criteria .\r\n",
      "The World heritage list is important because it attracts tourists and these landmarks are cherished by everyone around the world .\r\n",
      "It is also protected by UNESCO because they have found new animals or plants ; there are endangered species in that area or have a significant importance in history .\r\n",
      "World Heritage is the designation for places on Earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity and as such , have been inscribed on the World Heritage List to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy .\r\n",
      "The site is the property of the country on whose territory it is located , but it is considered in the interest of the international community to protect the site for future generations .\r\n",
      "Its protection and preservation has become a concern of the international World Heritage community as a whole .\r\n",
      "Another advantage for a site to be inscribed on the List is that once a country signs the Convention , and has sites inscribed on the World Heritage List , the resulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation .\r\n",
      "Greater awareness leads to a general rise in the level of protection and conservation given to heritage properties .\r\n",
      "A country may also receive financial assistance and expert advice from the World Heritage Committee to support activities for the preservation of its sites .\r\n",
      "The disadvantages of sites not included in the World Heritage List are that these sites are not funded so they ca n't protect them from risks .\r\n",
      "Moreover they remain in the list of sites in danger without receiving assistance .\r\n",
      "In my opinion , the sites in danger unless they do not answer ten criteria should be protected by UNESCO .\r\n",
      "It 's difficult , but I think that it is necessary to try to invent new ways to finance and defend the natural and cultural heritage .\r\n",

      "This movie has touched me very deeply , it made me think about life and about the way people used to live without appreciating the really important things .\r\n",

      "Before that I had always thought about getting married and having kids as a way to find happiness , but now I think that before this I need to do other things .\r\n",
      "It is very interesting to think that it was necessary to meet someone new , from another entire different culture to make me think about what I want .\r\n",
      "It is very strange that another person became curious about a very profound part of me that I have never thought of .\r\n",
      "Well , next November I will travel to Europe , the only certain thing on my Bucket List that I know .\r\n",
      "However , now I have an awful feeling about what I am doing today , because for the first time in my life I am sure that I need to change something , and I think this \" something \" is almost everything .\r\n",
      "People 's lives will change in the future , and I bet it 's not for the better .\r\n",
      "Unlike popular understandings of History ( and even presumably scientific ones , I must say ) , History is not an unstoppable march towards \" progress \" , whatever that word means .\r\n",
      "It is a cyclical process .\r\n",
      "Rome had its hayday in the first century AD , but just three centuries later it was only a shadow of its past .\r\n",
      "Those later period Romans were n't even able to make the high quality cement that their ancestors were able to make and have technical mastery over just a few centuries earlier .\r\n",
      "And who can safely say that three centuries from now humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and take for granted ?\r\n",
      "No one can confirm such a thing .\r\n",
      "But I do n't think , unless there 's another World War , people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .\r\n",
      "I think in the next 50 years the age of technology will have its peak , and after that there will be a decline , until a new Dark Ages .\r\n",
      "But let 's pick the World War hypothesis for a second .\r\n",
      "A wide world war is the only case in which we would see a dramatic change in people 's lives in the time length of 50 years from now .\r\n",
      "But are there , on this day , prospects for a new World War ?\r\n",
      "I do n't think so , but on the other hand what the hell do I know ?\r\n",
      "The causes that will lead to a new World War may well be in existence right now for all I know , and no one , or only a few very wise and intelligent people know about it .\r\n",
      "One day in the future another Franz Ferdinand could be killed , and that symbolic event could serve again as an excuse for some country to declare war on another , but the true underlying causes that actually led the countries to wage war against each other would have their roots in much older times .\r\n",
      "As the causes of the Second World War had its roots in events that were the outcome of the First War , a Third , hypothetical war , could have its roots in a past conflict that may well have happened already .\r\n",

      "Could you ask for your parents ' permission ?\r\n",
      "In this camp parents are calm and do n't worry about their children because they are in the care of a large number of assistants and the camp is situated on an entire island .\r\n",
      "In addition , the site was purpose built to provide places fit for young people , allowing them to do lots of activities in safety .\r\n",
      "There are a wide range of activities promoted by the staff all with the aim of enjoyment , especially outdoor sports activities !\r\n",
      "There are two swimming pools , two tennis courts , one football pitch , canoeing courses and so on but what I like most is scuba diving , and the equipment is provided .\r\n",
      "The Camp is well - known and opens from May to October and it would be good to book within two weeks . It always gets overbooked for the period my parents can take days off . What do you think is coming with us from the 1st August to the 15th ?\r\n",

      "Now we all live together .\r\n",
      "Although the first days were difficult , now we all get on well .\r\n",
      "It is great to be a whole family again .\r\n",
      "The Grand Place is the central square of Brussels .\r\n",
      "It is surrounded by several old buildings such as the city hall and the buildings of the corporations of the Middle Ages .\r\n",
      "There were groups of people doing the same work , such as carpenters .\r\n",
      "They helped each other and the elder ones taught the youngsters .\r\n",
      "Sometimes , they become very rich .\r\n",
      "Each building is decorated with the blazon of the corporation .\r\n",
      "Their architecture is unique and beautiful .\r\n",
      "Today , most of them are hosting cafés , shops and restaurants that attract a lot of tourists , but there is also the city museum .\r\n",
      "The square is covered with pavement and is a pedestrianized area .\r\n",
      "It is an important place for history because it is the oldest Grand Place in Europe and it is a part of the oldest neighbourhood of Brussels which is made of narrow paved streets , old and high buildings and , among other things , chocolate shops .\r\n",
      "Recently , several of the buildings have been restored and we can now better see their beautiful gilding and carvings .\r\n",
      "Every year , when Christmas comes , there is an amazing show with music and lights on the faáades of the buildings while a huge fir tree is placed in the centre of the square .\r\n",
      "Wawel Royal Castle is one of the highest ranked monuments in the history and culture of Poland and Europe , so during my stay in Poland it is necessary to visit it .\r\n",
      "The first Castle , called palatium , was built in the 11th century , and the remains of it are still visible inside the walls .\r\n",
      "During the next centuries it was expanded , and in the 16th century finally rebuilt in a Renaissance fashion , which remained unchanged until today - the most representative remnant is probably a famous arcaded coutyard .\r\n",
      "During the tour the visitors are shown several rooms and apartments , as well as Royal Private Apartments with far - famed tapestries of Polish kings collection .\r\n",
      "Another attraction of the tour is visiting the Crown Treasury , where Polish coronation insignia were stored , and armoury .\r\n",
      "Apart from the feature , there are also many marvellous exhibitions in the Castle containing its history as well as the other collections .\r\n",
      "While visiting Wawel Royal Castle one can not omit seeing Dragon 's Den - a cave under the Castle , where , according to the oldest legends , the dragon of Wawel lived .\r\n",
      "I recommend visiting Wawel Royal Castle because of its beauty and uniqueness .\r\n",
      "It is a symbol of a thousand years of Polish history and culture .\r\n",
      "Everyone will find something interesting among the variety of exhibitions and tours , and for certain it will be a memorable experience .\r\n",
      "I have been learning English as a second language since I was ten years old , which means a very long time ago .\r\n",
      "I think I was very lucky then because I have had the opportunity to learn English in a natural way , without books and tough lessons .\r\n",
      "My teachers thought it was better to learn by speaking , singing , and doing other activities in English , in a way similar to how we learn our own mother language .\r\n",
      "Moreover , I travelled to England and lived with English families for a few weeks every summer since I started learning until I was fifteen years old .\r\n",
      "So I grew up thinking I could speak and write quite good English .\r\n",
      "Even though I do have little theoretical knowledge about English grammar rules , I can make myself understood in a normal conversation , and I can write an email to a friend without making too many mistakes .\r\n",
      "One year ago I decided to take the Cambridge Advanced English exam in order to test my knowledge , thinking it would not be very difficult for me to be successful .\r\n",
      "I decided to enrol in a creative writing course in order to practise my writing skills .\r\n",
      "Along the course I had to accomplish some writing assignments and submit them to be evaluated by my peers .\r\n",
      "And there I realised at least two things : the first one that it is possible to learn how to write better ; the second one that even when you can make yourself generally understood , it is not so easy to be precise .\r\n",
      "A magician uses a dove and a black hat , but it would n't be a magic show if he did n't know how to perform the trick .\r\n",
      "In the same way , I had the ideas and the words but I had to admit that I needed to learn the rules of grammar if I wanted to do the magic trick of precise and stylish writing .\r\n",
      "Adolescence .\r\n",
      "Everybody says it 's the best period in our whole life ; what they do n't remember is that it could also be the worst .\r\n",
      "Adolescence could be compared to a foggy path and even when it seems you can see something throw it , in reality you do n't .\r\n",
      "This awful fog is composed of our uncontrolled emotions .\r\n",
      "Everything is unknown , but we try to pretend that we know a lot of things .\r\n",
      "This could be one of the reasons why we get angry so easily and so often with our parents : every time we discover something new or we say something , they judge us or they begin some long speeches to try to change our ideas .\r\n",
      "Another thing about the relationship between parents and adolescents is the fact that they confuse our minds .\r\n",
      "As I said , adolescents could be very confused and if there 's a thing that gets under our skin is when moms say something and then tell us to do the opposite .\r\n",
      "The worst part is that they get angry with us !\r\n",
      "We 're confused , they 're not clear and then they also get angry and they 're surprised when we get mad at them !\r\n",
      "It 's true that we should always be respectful but sometimes it turns out to be impossible because they do everything to provoke us .\r\n",
      "I think the most important thing in the relationship with our parents is to find a sort of accordance , because in the end we do n't only feel anger for them but also a lot of love .\r\n",
      "Love : That 's a new feeling that adolescents have to face .\r\n",
      "It 's not the usual love they 're used to feeling , like love for family and friends , but it 's a new kind of love .\r\n",
      "It 's a kind of love that struggles ; it makes butterflies fly in our stomach , it makes us dive into a sort of imaginary tale .\r\n",
      "That kind of love that we see in movies and we dream of ; the type of love that does n't make us fall asleep at night .\r\n",
      "It is a period in which we have our first experiences , and it is as scary as it is exciting .\r\n",
      "Adolescence is like this , there 's a moment that looks magical and in the following one you drown in the dark .\r\n",
      "Dear group leader ,\r\n",
      "First of all , I would like to thank you for the interest shown in our small village .\r\n",
      "I really hope that you have a nice welcome and , please , feel at home .\r\n",
      "Here , in Mallorca , there are a lot of places to visit but I will recommend you a unique place , without tourists , noise and crowded beaches .\r\n",
      "On the east side of Mallorca you will find a small and beautiful village called Arté.\r\n",
      "In the municipality of Artéyou will find a coaster town , situated on the edge of the mountain range of Llevant .\r\n",
      "Sa Colánia de Sant Pere is a traditional fishermen 's village .\r\n",
      "Nowadays , you can still see some fishermen fishing on the seashore .\r\n",
      "Here your adventure starts .\r\n",
      "In order to get to your destination , you must ride a bicycle and just enjoy the splendid panoramic view .\r\n",
      "You will ride until Ca los cans , one of the most enigmatic beaches of Mallorca .\r\n",
      "This zone is part of a protected area , a natural park .\r\n",
      "For that reason , you must go riding a bike or walking .\r\n",
      "As Machado said , \" se hace camino al andar \" .\r\n",
      "It means that the most important thing is the journey .\r\n",
      "Going on a bike near the seashore with the breeze of the sea is one of the most relaxing experiences in life .\r\n",
      "On the way to Ca los cans , you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation .\r\n",
      "There are a lot of trees called \" tamarells \" , native trees of the coast of Mallorca .\r\n",
      "Moreover , you will go between two ancient obelisks which have been recently restored .\r\n",
      "Finally , you will get to Ca los Cans .\r\n",
      "It is a special beach with stones instead of sand and surrounded by trees instead of hotels .\r\n",
      "There you can do different sports .\r\n",
      "It is a perfect place to go diving because you can see different fishes , sea urchins and seaweed .\r\n",
      "There you can also take a canoe and paddle in the quiet sea .\r\n",
      "Apart from sports , you should note two different cultural points .\r\n",
      "On the one hand , there is what remains standing of edificatications that were used to keep the small boats of the local fishermen safe from storms .\r\n",
      "On the other hand , there is a prehistorical tower called \" Talaiot \" .\r\n",
      "The function of the Talaiots is not clear yet .\r\n",
      "Maybe it was a defensive tower or an important building for high - class people .\r\n",
      "It is important to stay on the beach until the sun goes down .\r\n",
      "The sunset in that place is ideal and romantic ( especially if you are with your partner ) and you will see how the sun goes behind the mountain range of Tramuntana .\r\n",
      "From that seashore you can see all the Alcádia bay , part of the mountain range of Tramuntana and the cape of Formentor .\r\n",
      "Ca los Cans is a mixture of sea , nature and culture .\r\n",
      "I am sure that you will like it and , of course , I need to ask you a favour : Please , keep the secret .\r\n",
      "With regards ,\r\n",
      "Paula .\r\n",
      "Introduction .\r\n",
      "The aim of this report is to outline the best and the worst qualities of your centre after one year running .\r\n",
      "This report analyses the two main facilities : the gym and the swimming pool .\r\n",
      "The gym .\r\n",
      "The machines are fantastic and the staff is very helpful to every customer .\r\n",
      "On the other hand , the gym is too small .\r\n",
      "Every afternoon it is crowded so it is very difficult to exercise .\r\n",
      "The swimming pool .\r\n",
      "It is ideal for people who do not compete because of its length , about 20 metres .\r\n",
      "Furthermore , it is not too deep , so it is excellent for people who want to learn how to swim .\r\n",
      "On the other hand , the changing rooms are too far from this facility , so it is easy to catch a cold when someone goes from one place to another .\r\n",
      "Conclusions .\r\n",
      "The facilities are quite modern and the staff are excellent but the gym could be bigger .\r\n",
      "Furthermore , you would put heaters to avoid colds in the passage way from the changing rooms to the swimming pool .\r\n",
      "The Future of Public Transport\r\n",
      "When we imagine the future , we rarely imagine overcrowded buses and rusty subway trains .\r\n",
      "As technologies develop and become cheaper , more and more people buy personal cars .\r\n",
      "A car allows us to move faster and not depend on others .\r\n",
      "Travelling by car is also much more convenient .\r\n",
      "Does this all mean that the years of public transportation have come to an end ?\r\n",
      "In my opinion , that is not true .\r\n",
      "Firstly , there will always be people who will not be able to afford to buy a car .\r\n",
      "Students , children from large families , and old people will continue to use public transportation for a long time .\r\n",
      "Secondly , cars can also turn into public transport .\r\n",
      "Science fiction often depicts the future as the world where cars are used freely .\r\n",
      "Anyone can use the nearest car he or she sees .\r\n",
      "Thirdly , people do not have an inborn driving skill , so even in the future children and teenagers will need public transportation .\r\n",
      "This is also true for older people , who lose the ability to drive as they age .\r\n",
      "In conclusion , public transportation is not likely to disappear , at least during the nearest tens of years .\r\n",
      "The chart above gives some information about the average monthly salaries of nurses and doctors in four different countries .\r\n",
      "According to the chart , the two countries with the lowest salaries are Country A and Country B.\r\n",
      "These ones are called \" source countries \" , which means that they provide a supply of health care workers to other countries .\r\n",
      "Otherwise , the countries with the highest salaries are country C and country D. Differently from the first two countries , these ones are called \" destination countries \" because the health care service is provided by foreign and qualified workers .\r\n",
      "Moreover , in the first three countries doctors earn about twice as much as a nurse earns , apart from the last country , Country D. In this one , the salary gap between doctors and nurses is bigger than in other countries .\r\n",
      "In Country D , the salaries of doctors are about three times higher than those of nurses .\r\n",
      "In conclusion we can say that from the standpoint of doctors and nurses , working abroad is a much better deal .\r\n",
      "Boxing is a common , well known and well loved sport amongst most countries in the world however it is also punishing , dangerous and disliked to the extent that many people want it banned , possibly with good reason .\r\n",
      "Boxing is a dangerous sport , there are relatively common deaths , tragic injuries and even disease .\r\n",
      "All professional boxers are at risk from being killed in his next fight .\r\n",
      "If not killed then I would be more likely to be paralysed .\r\n",
      "There have been a number of cases in the last ten years of the top few boxers having tragic losses throughout their ranks .\r\n",
      "This is just from the elite few , and there 's more from those below them .\r\n",
      "More deaths would occur through boxing if it were banned .\r\n",
      "The sport would go underground , there would be no safety measures like gloves , a doctor , paramedics or early stopping of the fight if someone looked unable to continue .\r\n",
      "With this going on , the people taking part will be dangerous , and on the streets .\r\n",
      "Dangerous dogs who were trained to kill and maim in similar underground dog fights have already proved deadly to innocent people . The new boxers could be even more at risk .\r\n",
      "Once boxing is banned and no - one grows up knowing it as acceptable there will be no interest in boxing and hopefully less all round interest in violence making towns and cities much safer places to live in . There will be less fighting outside pubs and clubs and less violent attacks with little or no reason .\r\n",
      "Changing the rules of boxing slightly would much improve the safety risks of the sport and not detract from the entertainment .\r\n",
      "There are all sorts of proposals , lighter and more cushioning gloves could be worn , ban punches to the head , headguards worn or make fights shorter , as most of the serious injuries occur in the latter rounds , these would all show off the boxers skill and talent and still be entertaining to watch .\r\n",
      "Even if a boxer is a success and manages not to be seriously hurt he still faces serious consequences in later life diseases that attack the brains have been known to set in as a direct result of boxing , even Muhamed Ali , who was infamous both for his boxing and his quick - witted intelligence now has Alzheimer 's disease and can no longer do many everyday acts .\r\n",
      "Many other sports are more dangerous than boxing , motor sports and even mountaineering have risks that are real .\r\n",
      "Boxers chose to box , just as racing drivers drive .\r\n",
      "In many of the minority works of modern literature , there can be some emphasis on rebellion against oppressive forces .\r\n",
      "Although such a show of strength by these works ' characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contribution to the otherwise insightful thought of the author , it is this conflict upon which many stories of ethnic American literature are based .\r\n",
      "However , such a rebellion can not be seen clearly in each minority work , and , therefore , the products of ethnic American literature can not be catagorized as merely the result of years of oppression .\r\n",
      "Rather , this ever - changing and ever - challenging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individually as both a product of years of struggle and a work inherently distinct from any other .\r\n",
      "In the minority works , the conflict and rebellion presented accurately reflects society as a whole , and although the mother 's in The Joy Luck Club rebel against such forces as arranged marriages , Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions , and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from the US government , the characters ' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures .\r\n",
      "Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding force between all cultures , for Celie , too , resists her arranged marriage in The Color Purple , and the murderous loves in Jazz reflect Tita and Pedro 's destructive passion in Like Water for Chocolate .\r\n",
      "Rebellion and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , but they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .\r\n",
      "Emphasis changes with each work , and although figures of authority are particularly oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple , other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters ' responsive action which the previously mentioned works show .\r\n",
      "This again implies that these ethnic American pieces of literature can not be catagorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences .\r\n",
      "How does Voltaire tackle the question of philosophical optimism in ' Candide ' ?\r\n",
      "Philosophical optimism -l'optimisme- is the philosophy that everything and occurence is for some good .\r\n",
      "Voltaire set out in Candide to criticise this philosophy .\r\n",
      "In Candide , the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher employed at Thunder - der - Troncks .\r\n",
      "The whole book is a criticism of l'optimism .\r\n",
      "For example when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not concern himself because he knows it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier .\r\n",
      "Although this would seem to be good it is not because of his training he kills two men , a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then proceeds to kill his sweetheart brother .\r\n",
      "Voltaire shows his dislike of l'optimism when Pangloss , Candide and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors , Candide , Pangloss and a sailor .\r\n",
      "The storm was caused by an earthquake which destroyed the city to which Candide was sailing .\r\n",
      "On arrival they see starvation and death .\r\n",
      "Candide is obviously horrified , especially when the sailor begins pillaging the city .\r\n",
      "Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Pangloss can only tell him that some good will come of it .\r\n",
      "Candide , although remaining true to the ideals of optimism , always appears to be sceptical of it .\r\n",
      "This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world , South America , and has to leave his darling Cunégonde with the Commissioner of the province .\r\n",
      "Candide can not see what possible good can come of this , especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cunégonde 's lovers .\r\n",
      "Throughout the book we begin to see how Candide is gradually leading away for l'optimism or perhaps more importantly how l'optimism is shown to be the philosophy of despair .\r\n",
      "The constant belief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant flow of disasters .\r\n",
      "Candide 's life , in the book , appears to show this .\r\n",
      "He is thrown out of Thunder - den - Tronck because he embraces Cunégonde , he is duped into the army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almost killed as part of an auto - da - fé , he kills three churchmen , he is almost eaten , he finds Eldorado but leaves - the list continues .\r\n",
      "Candide 's life is governed by his belief that good will prevail .\r\n",
      "Eventually , of course , he does marry Cunégonde but she is not the beautiful young flower that he once loved .\r\n",
      "She has become ugly and has grown worse by the day .\r\n",
      "This illustrates emphatically the folly of l'optimism .\r\n",
      "Candide has travelled the world in search of Cunégonde , with the hope that he will marry her despite all the trouble which he has gone through . Of course in the end he does get Cunégonde but at the price of her looks and personality .\r\n",
      "Voltaire , in Candide , shows how the philosophy of Optimism is one of despair not hope .\r\n",
      "It would be tempting to think of the various European Communities as an embryonic United States of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of European Unity .\r\n",
      "However , it is important to realise that Europe is a very long way from becoming anything like the United States .\r\n",
      "When the original 13 American states resolved to form what is now the United States of America , they were intent on forming a political as well as economic entity .\r\n",
      "They were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the newly formed national government to operate as a single international political force .\r\n",
      "A balance was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual states as much self - government as possible while ensuring that , for example in military matters , the central government spoke for all .\r\n",
      "It is true that today one still hears the old dispute over state sovereignty and attempts to return some power to the individual states , but no - one would challenge the fact that , on matters external to the United States , the government in Washington represents the sole policy - making body .\r\n",
      "In Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to see a political union of the countries since this would produce a formidable international military force .\r\n",
      "However it is equally clear that while there might be some unified political action flowing from the European Communities ( such as was seen over Europe 's response to the British involvement in the Falkland Islands dispute ) , the Communities were intended as purely economic entities in the first place .\r\n",
      "Membership almost certainly involves some loss of national sovereignty , but the United Kingdom could probably leave the community by a simple majority vote in the Westminster Parliament , something which no state in the United States could lawfully do .\r\n",
      "We are still a very long way from a Single Parliament for Western Europe with the power to make political decisions for all ; and even with 1992 approaching and a single market , the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide .\r\n",
      "The supremacy of Parliament will never be challenged .\r\n",
      "Its ability to make and break any law - made by it or Europe - means that it retains full sovereignty .\r\n",
      "Even if today it made laws that would unite it fully with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty forever , it could tomorrow repeal all those laws .\r\n",
      "The fact that Parliament does not bind itself or can not be bound by any political body means that it can never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population wished it and Parliament consented .\r\n",
      "But with the average jingoistic Briton there is no chance of us curing ourselves of our xenophobia and ever wishing to be fully integrated with Europe .\r\n",
      "Even now the channel tunnel has joined us to the continent . We still consider ourselves to be separated from the world , standing alone against a hostile world .\r\n",
      "Naturally , the problems of a single Europe would run as deep as the benefits that we would presumably ultimately receive .\r\n",
      "It seems to me that for the past few centuries , Britain has always considered itself to be detached from the rest of Europe .\r\n",
      "Whenever necessary , she has allied herself to European powers , such as in times of war of extreme distrust .\r\n",
      "Britain has been eager to maintain a secure balance of power on the continent , but throughout history , she has been more concerned with her overseas empires than with anywhere else .\r\n",
      "In the latter half century though , her empire has diminished and she has had to face mounting responsibility in Europe .\r\n",
      "Because of her history of isolated sovereignty , it is difficult to accept being a part of a single Europe .\r\n",
      "For instance , British law is based largely upon precedent , that is judge made law .\r\n",
      "We have established a system of law which dates back many centuries , and which is widely known and respected .\r\n",
      "There is very little European influence on our law , of course in many respects it will be the same , but the lack of influence will display many differences .\r\n",
      "With the creation of a single Europe , a new law will have to be accepted throughout the continent , and it will cause both confusion and conflict .\r\n",
      "The British tend to be very proud and possessive of the law , and changes may well cause illfeeling and discontent .\r\n",
      "Of course , the same points will apply to the monetary system in Europe .\r\n",
      "Will there just be one system ?\r\n",
      "The country typically is against major change and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it were to be altered .\r\n",
      "Our individual monetary system , I suppose , could be seen as a symbol of sovereignty .\r\n",
      "It can be said that if a single Europe was created , problems may arise over its fundamental political concepts .\r\n",
      "Of course Britain would lose its sovereignty , as would the other nations of the union .\r\n",
      "It has been suggested that the Single Union could be based on a basic federal structure , whereby local autonomy could be saved , but the union as a whole could work together in a democratic manner .\r\n",
      "To a certain extent , even if sovereignty was lost , some national personality would be preserved .\r\n",
      "The fact is that , when united , European unity would still in essence be divided .\r\n",
      "There will always be aspects of one society that the others will never accept .\r\n",
      "Europe as a whole faces the same problems , and therefore , if a single Europe was created , uniting Britain , the problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently .\r\n",
      "If the Federalists achieved their aims in a European unity , they would do their best to achieve democracy and promote it nationally , so that individuality is preserved , and that all of their positive features will be known .\r\n",
      "The problem facing the British really results from their isolated past .\r\n",
      "The sovereignty of the nation has deep roots , and the fears of losing it are very great .\r\n",
      "Whether this would happen awaits to be seen , and would depend completely on the terms of the union , and the negotiations and feelings of the general public and the politicians leading the countries .\r\n",
      "With 1992 now only a year away , the question of what a Single Europe will mean for Britain becomes increasingly relevant .\r\n",
      "I firmly believe that the advent of 1992 will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain .\r\n",
      "This loss need not however be negative .\r\n",
      "In fact , in political , economic and defence terms I feel this realocation of resources can and will be very positive .\r\n",
      "Whilst to a certain extent I may be guilty of having an island mentality , I would n't go as far as to say Britain is in danger of handing all control over to faceless beaurocrats in Brussels or Strasbourg .\r\n",
      "Throughout the world a wind of change is apparent , but especially so in Europe .\r\n",
      "This process will continue and Europe the rest of the world will evolve with or without the participation of Britain in this process .\r\n",
      "It is my belief that Britain must be involved in the decision making which will eventually decide the new world order .\r\n",
      "However , to be fully involved , sacrifices have to be made .\r\n",
      "Such sacrifices will involve certain aspects of our sovereignty .\r\n",
      "In relenquishing and thus centralising certain powers , the aim is not to diminish the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world stage .\r\n",
      "As amply demonstrated by recent events in the Gulf , European cooperation in the field of defence can be both impressive and effective . Whilst I would be reluctant to hand over all control to defence to any central body .\r\n",
      "I can see a future for some form of European rapid reaction force .\r\n",
      "Whilst to an extent crippling defence costs could be cut this would not necessarily lead to a reduction in the size of defence available .\r\n",
      "In political terms , regardless of legislation , Britain , like the rest of Europe , is becoming increasingly cosmopolitan in terms of population composition .\r\n",
      "The North Sea will increasingly come to represent a mere puddle as people move between countries .\r\n",
      "I feel it is important for Britain to join fully with its European partners to adapt to these changes in demography .\r\n",
      "Politically , we are moving closer together .\r\n",

      "Whilst not pretending to fully understand this system , I do know that no system can lower interest rates and inflation while raising growth , with the possible exception of the Magic Circle .\r\n",
      "In the area of the single currency , again I feel this is inevitable .\r\n",
      "What is important is to base this currency on the strong currencies within the EEC as opposed to an average based system .\r\n",
      "To conclude I would say a single Europe is already happening and that it will continue to do so is guaranteed .\r\n",
      "Britain must not concern itself with loss of sovereignty but gain of the European equivalent .\r\n",

      "When the treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 , the foundation was laid for a new \" continent \" - a united Europe .\r\n",
      "It was said that Europe would not be created quickly , but over several years .\r\n",
      "When Britain entered the European Community in 1973 after a national referendum , the debate began concerning Britain 's relationship with Europe .\r\n",
      "When 1992 was set as the date for the single European Market , the debate flared up again , but over how far Britain should be integrated .\r\n",
      "The rest of Europe seems prepared for 1992 but Britain seems to be decidedly hesitant .\r\n",
      "The former Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher was not to lead Britain into a United Europe because she felt it would lead to a loss of our sovereignty .\r\n",
      "There is no doubt an integrated market would have multiple benefits for the countries involved .\r\n",
      "Businesses and other trading organizations are preparing themselves for 1992 , and the single market .\r\n",
      "Trade will be easier , with no frontier controls allowing free flowing transportation of merchandise .\r\n",
      "There will be business booms and free competition with the removal of protective practices , along with greater freedom to travel .\r\n",
      "Many Britons would consider Europe has affected Britain too much already , with decimalization , the new Euro - passports and now the pound sterling being tied to the ECU .\r\n",
      "They may feel Britain is being pulled into Europe .\r\n",
      "Further changes are forecast for Britain , effecting day to day matters , to create a \" European Standard \" .\r\n",

      "A single market requires one central institution to co - ordinate all movements of goods and policies .\r\n",
      "Will the people of Britain be prepared to give up their government and be directed from Strasbourg or Brussels ?\r\n",
      "Many people would not .\r\n",
      "Will the day come when the pound sterling is taken over by the ECU ?\r\n",
      "It may well - but will the Britons have a chance to voice their opinions and views ?\r\n",
      "Europe may argue that the benefits from a single integrated market would far outweigh any national drawbacks .\r\n",
      "As the date draws nearer , the awareness of Britons to Europe must increase .\r\n",
      "They must look into the future and consider possible effects .\r\n",
      "Will Britain be drawn into Europe against its will ?\r\n",
      "Perhaps as more of Britain becomes \" Eurofied \" , Britons will wake up and see their sovereignty is being taken away .\r\n",
      "Britain has never geographically been a part of Europe .\r\n",
      "We are in the EEC and we should be able to benefit from free trade .\r\n",
      "We have been an island for too long - being independent and able to stand alone .\r\n",
      "We have a sound democratic process , which many people would not want to give up .\r\n",
      "A fully integrated market with Britain as a full member would be to the detriment of our political system and consequently lead to a loss of sovereignty .\r\n",
      "There has been such a lot of talk about a Single Europe in recent years that it is hard to believe that it will be upon us very soon .\r\n",
      "Now that it is a reality , and not just a probability , the question in the minds of many Britons is indeed : Will this mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain or the birth of a nation ?\r\n",
      "Firstly , a positive approach .\r\n",
      "Looking at things from an economic perspective , this is not a problem .\r\n",
      "The benefits in terms of cost - cutting owing to doing things once , instead of twelve times , will be enormous .\r\n",
      "Firms , because of being able to pool their resources , will be able to devote more time to research and development , and thus products will improve .\r\n",
      "Europe will therefore be a nation to be reckoned with as regards competition .\r\n",
      "To look at things on a more individual level , every member of the new Single Europe 's standard of living should increase .\r\n",
      "A greater potential of ideas from a greater number of experts will , in theory , result in more knowledgeable and better - informed individuals .\r\n",
      "Simplicity is one of the Commission 's key aims , with the idea that if things are simpler and easier for everyone to understand people will be happier , get on better .\r\n",
      "If this is so , they should also work better .\r\n",
      "Ideally then , there should be more equality , less crime , greater productivity and greater economic growth .\r\n",
      "On the other hand , will this Single Europe mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain ?\r\n",
      "It must be remembered that not only does Britain have a small population compared to the majority of the other member states , but it is an island - which none of the others are .\r\n",
      "Why should this matter ?\r\n",
      "Well , Britain has quite a history and therefore a fair number of traditions .\r\n",
      "It is possible that it could become engulfed in the new Single Europe and lose its identity .\r\n",
      "Britons ( especially those from older generations ) may then feel \" lost \" and that they do not really \" belong \" any more .\r\n",
      "The new Single Europe may be too new and unknown for them to show their allegiance to it .\r\n",
      "Then there is the question as to whether all this idealism really will work .\r\n",
      "Will there be greater prosperity , better - informed , happier citizens , or will this never come off because of politicians being unable to agree on policies ?\r\n",
      "Britain , although small , is more often than not in the forefront of international matters , taking a definite stance on what it considers to be right .\r\n",
      "Has it then not got quite a lot at stake , its character at least , in integrating itself into this Single Europe ?\r\n",
      "No one would dispute that this is a difficult question .\r\n",
      "The fact remains however that next year ( in 1992 ) there is going to be a single Europe .\r\n",
      "This , as everyone is well aware , is not going to be achieved with ease , but the more tolerant every member state is of each other , the more successful Single Europe will be .\r\n",
      "It is up to Britain therefore to accept this fact and to show an example by leading the way as regards tolerance .\r\n",
      "Then we will all be able to look at the future in a more positive way .\r\n",
      "The European Community is a unique grouping of twelve sovereign European Member States who are committed to the development of closer economic and political co - operation .\r\n",
      "The community has an aim to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe .\r\n",
      "In particular , the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frontiers ; movement not only of goods but of services , capital and people .\r\n",
      "However , the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much debated one ; to what extent should a member hand over its sovereignty to the Community , if at all ?\r\n",
      "Let us look at the founding of the European Community , before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in more detail .\r\n",
      "There were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World War , but only after Europe had again been devastated by war was the futility of national rivalry truly apparent .\r\n",
      "The political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re - ordering of Europe .\r\n",
      "This fresh start came about because of three main factors .\r\n",
      "Firstly , it was Europe 's realization of her own weakness , after having lost her age - old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union .\r\n",
      "These superpowers were economically , militarily and politically stronger than the divided individual European states .\r\n",
      "Secondly was the conviction that military conflict should in the future be avoided ; after all , the two great wars had both begun as European \" civil wars \" . Thirdly was the common desire for a better , freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way .\r\n",
      "One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community in 1958 .\r\n",
      "Its membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty - three .\r\n",
      "One of the most innovative features of the European Community compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its own sovereign powers , which it can use to adopt acts , having the force of national law .\r\n",
      "This novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called \" integration \" .\r\n",
      "The 1970 's saw progress in integration , with the introduction of community policy instruments , which enabled greater scope for national policies .\r\n",
      "All of the member states agree in principle to the idea of a single market by 1992 , however each wishes their own interests to be safeguarded .\r\n",
      "This is to say that no one wants to sacrifice their national sovereignty , many want unanimous voting , not majority voting .\r\n",
      "Many see this issue as a threat to their own regulations and laws , and could foresee a drop in standards if they do not stand firm .\r\n",
      "The situation is seen as a threat to the countries in question who do not wish to boldly give up their sovereignty for the sake of European unity .\r\n",
      "Whether or not the continuation of progress in the field of European unity is successful depends very much on the people of Europe .\r\n",
      "If a feeling of European unity develops and can be sustained , the threat will subside as a feeling of identity takes over .\r\n",
      "On British roads there is an ever increasing volume of traffic .\r\n",
      "The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hold - ups and traffic jams ..\r\n",
      "To remedy this , the government has started adding a fourth lane on some stretches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses , with mixed reception .\r\n",
      "While the road system is being improved there seems to be an endless series of roadworks which restrict the highways and cause further delays while the roadworks are in place .\r\n",
      "The inability to cope with the amount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drivers having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic .\r\n",
      "It might seem an easy solution to this mayhem would be to use public transport ; i.e. the Railways .\r\n",
      "People are not taking to the Rail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privitisation of different areas .\r\n",
      "It has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route !\r\n",
      "The main disadvantage with the railways is as the rail service and the bus service are normally owned by different companies . It is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train .\r\n",
      "If the services were integrated there would be a bus timetable which coincided with the train arrival times .\r\n",
      "Then people would be more likely to catch the train as they would not have to look forward to a long walk , wait for a boat or an expensive taxi ride .\r\n",
      "My solution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services . This would get people off the roads and onto the trains .\r\n",
      "To improve the rail service trains have got to be timed to arrive and depart at key times i.e. arrive at eight o'clock and leave at half past six .\r\n",
      "The train and bus companies have to liase with each other and the train fares have to remain relatively cheap i.e. the same price or less as it would cost to go by car .\r\n",
      "The basic dilemma facing the UK 's rail and road transport system is the general rise in population .\r\n",
      "This leads to an increase in the number of commuters and transport users every year , consequently putting pressure on the UKS transport network .\r\n",
      "The biggest worry to the system is the rapid rise of car users outside the major cities .\r\n",
      "Most large cities have managed to encourage commuters to use public transport , thus decreasing major congestion in rush hour periods .\r\n",
      "Public transport is the obvious solution to the increase in population . If it is made cheap for commuters , clean , easy and efficient , then it could take the strain of the overloaded British roads .\r\n",
      "For commuters who regularly travel long distances , rail transport should be made more appealing , more comfortable and cheaper .\r\n",
      "Motorways and other transport links are constantly being extended , widened and slowly turning the country into a concrete jungle yet it is only trying to cope with the increase in traffic . We are our own enemy !\r\n",
      "Another major problem created by the mass of vehicle transport is the pollution emitted into the atmosphere damaging the ozone layer , creating smog and forming acid rain . Touring the Earth we are living on .\r\n",
      "In conclusion , I wish to propose clean , efficient , comfortable and cheap public transport for the near future .\r\n",
      "Modern traffic jams are now a familiar situation to nearly all of the western world 's population .\r\n",
      "If every time we use our cars to travel any distance we find ourselves in a 10 mile tail - back , why do we still insist that we travel in such a manner ?\r\n",
      "To illustrate my point , if every time you take a train , it stops for 2 hours on the track , everyone would stop taking it .\r\n",
      "So why do we still insist on travelling on the road ?\r\n",
      "The answer most likely lies in 2 areas , firstly the attitude of many westerners is that \" it is their right to travel in such a manner ' .\r\n",
      "This , in my opinion , shows considerable ignorance .\r\n",
      "I am by far and away no ' greeny ' who wants to make everyone live in tipee 's and eat soya bean soup , however I do agree that something should be done about the volume of traffic that is on our roads today .\r\n",
      "The governments answer to the considerably growing amount of traffic on our roads just to back move . They are not even attempting to treat the cause , so more and more people are now driving .\r\n",
      "We all feel that we have a divine right to be on the road .\r\n",
      "Why ?\r\n",
      "Do we , the western world ( 5% of the population of the world ) , have the right to use the resources of the rest of the world at the environmental cost ?\r\n",
      "Just because we can not be bothered to get out of bed a bit earlier to catch public transport .\r\n",
      "Even if we do , then shortly so does the rest of the world .\r\n",
      "That could have disastrous implications .\r\n",
      "The 2nd reason is the problem that the public transport service , for example rail , is declining so much , there is no train to catch in the morning .\r\n",
      "People stopped using trains because of the fall in standards . These people were forced onto the road , routes became unprofitable and so were closed and services cut back , forcing more people onto the roads .\r\n",
      "The whole system has now formed a spiraling circle of road use .\r\n",
      "This has now been intensified with the sale of the railways , to private rail companies , profit motivated .\r\n",
      "The vital , small rail links may now be closed . Previously they were subsudised to make up the loss . Now the private companies can not afford to do this so many will close , cutting off small towns and villages .\r\n",
      "The only way to stop the circle will be to break it . The only people to do this is the government or ourselves . If we make the effort to use public transport , it will expand into a good service ; Unfortunately the public seems to be appethetic to this idea .\r\n",
      "Today , boxing has become a very popular sport , with T.V. channels competing for coverage of certain events and fighters earning a lot of money . This is a big business .\r\n",
      "Apart from athletics , boxing seems to be the only popular international sport which Britain can still hold to head high .\r\n",
      "We have superb fighters with excellent characters such as Lennox Lewis , Nigel Benn , Nasheem Hamed and our beloved Frank Bruno .\r\n",
      "Despite being enjoyable to watch , boxing is very dangerous .\r\n",
      "Blows to the head can cause the brain to rattle about the skull , which may cause a brain clot or tumor .\r\n",
      "Last year , the fight between Chris Eubank and Micheal Watson led to calls for boxing to be banned when Micheal Watson slipped into a coma and was in a critical condition for some months .\r\n",
      "Many youths in low income areas see boxing as ' a way out ' , a chance to make it to the top and earn a lot of money on the way .\r\n",
      "There are , however , people who regard boxing as barbaric , brutal and primitive .\r\n",
      "These people argue that there is no need for boxing and that it only promotes violence .\r\n",
      "During the fight , yes , of course it is violent , but this is controlled violence and fighters have a mutual respect for each other .\r\n",
      "All precautions are taken to ensure a safe fight .\r\n",
      "During fights doctors keep close to the ring and have the authority to call it off prematurely if required .\r\n",
      "Ambulances are also kept on stand by at big events .\r\n",
      "Although it may sound cruel , I do not believe that any fighter has entered a professional boxing career without knowing the risks .\r\n",
      "Because there are so many budding young boxers , to ban boxing would be insane , since it would almost certainly go underground .\r\n",
      "Underground fights are far more dangerous since less protective gear is used and there usually is n't a doctor present .\r\n",
      "Taking this into account and considering that boxing is about hurting the opponent , it can be said that boxing is a relatively safe sport .\r\n",
      "Although far less popular , there are other sports which are far more brutal and dangerous , such as ' Thai Boxing ' , where competitors are encouraged to use their knees and elbows .\r\n",
      "The argument continues , but for the sake of safety in the long term I do not think boxing will be banned .\r\n",
      "Which is good news for the majority of the British public .\r\n",
      "Two men , one ring , only one can leave . Dramatic it may be but basically that is the main principal of boxing .\r\n",
      "Although throughout the years rules have been made to dilute the sport 's sadistic side , should boxing be banned ?\r\n",
      "Every time a boxer gets punched in the head , his brain moves vigorously inside his skull .\r\n",
      "This causes the boxer to lose many brain cells per boxing fight and if this occurs frequently then the boxer can end his career with brain damage .\r\n",
      "In my eyes and probably the eyes of others , this is reason enough for the banning of boxing .\r\n",
      "The sport to say the least is actually a blood sport , the simple reason being that the idea of the sport is to ' knock your opposition out ' . Although this is argued by Chris Eubank , he believes he is a sportsman and the idea of boxing is an art form , he says that he does not specifically go into a boxing ring to knock his opponent out but to win on points differences and to give Chris Eubank his just respect , most of his fights have been won on points .\r\n",
      "But there is one exception - the original example , the first reference why boxing should be banned , the tragic accident where Michael Watson was put into a coma by Chris Eubank ( the man who does n't specifically go into fights to knock his opponent out ) .\r\n",
      "This example only proves too well what a dangerous so called ' sport ' boxing is .\r\n",
      "The boxing federation is trying to do as much as it can to make the ' spot ' safer having rungside doctors , banning bare hand fights but the top and bottom of the argument is that any blow to the head causes considerable damage .\r\n",
      "There is always much speculation over the dangers of such a brutal sport as boxing .\r\n",
      "This is emphasised and exaggerated when a competitor in the sport tragically dies .\r\n",
      "A recent death in the ring has inevitably led to a public uproar over the safety of the sport , and the controversy over whether the sport should be banned or not is yet again at the forefront of discussion .\r\n",
      "Let us consider how a professional boxer would feel .\r\n",
      "He is clearly aware of the dangers and brutalism of the sport , which is possibly why he enjoys it so much .\r\n",
      "I have yet to hear any boxer regret his choice of career .\r\n",
      "The excitement of being in the ring , the joy at knocking an opponent onto the canvass , and all the money that is there to be made are overwhelming factors which keep boxers fighting .\r\n",
      "The money that is there for the taking for the very best of the best is ridiculous , and with some top boxers earning sums of money such as £ 20 million ( or in Mike Tysons comeback case , $ 60 million ! ) it is hardly surprising how important the sport can be to some .\r\n",
      "Let us consider ' Sky ' viewes , recently beginning a subscription to view Tysons ' \" Next Live Lights \" .\r\n",
      "This member of the public does not want the sport to be banned either .\r\n",
      "Now let us consider the friends or family of a boxer , who has been permanently injured ( or been killed due to a fight ) .\r\n",
      "These individuals and others are learning about the tragic incident in the media protest against the sport .\r\n",
      "The family , who were originally against the idea of their son finishing college early to take up the sport would be leading the protests against boxing .\r\n",
      "How pleased , proud and patriotic the British public felt when Frank Bruno achieved his ultimate goal and became the Heavyweight champion of the world , yet how sorry many were to see him return to boxing after his head injuries earlier in his career .\r\n",
      "This hypocritical view is shoved by so many that whether boxing should be banned or not will remain a controversial issue for the forseeable future .\r\n",
      "There were 2 main objections raised against the introduction of the national lottery .\r\n",
      "The first was the objection that the lottery would be little more than another form of taxation , in fact , none other than that , a tax on the poor .\r\n",
      "The second and main objection came from charities who predicted that charitable donations would go down with the introduction of the lottery , as people would be less likely to give money to charity , instead of buying a lottery ticket , with the excuse that some of the money spent buying the ticket would go to charity .\r\n",
      "There was also some controversy over the awarding of the lottery organisation franchise , which eventually went to Camelot , which was not seen as the strongest contender for the bid : other companies or consortiums promised to give more money to charity with lower running costs .\r\n",
      "Richard Bronson promised to give all of his profits to charity , but was rejected .\r\n",
      "My personal objection to Camelot as the lottery organiser is that a large proportion of the consortium are American or foreign firms . For example , IBM has a sizeable stake in Camelot .\r\n",
      "The British national lottery is run by non British firms .\r\n",
      "Since its introduction there has been more controversy over the national lottery .\r\n",
      "When it promised to give 45 pence in every pound to charitable causes , it neglected to promise that most or all of this money would go to charity .\r\n",
      "There has also been some controversy over the allocation of money .\r\n",
      "For example , 3 million pounds were given to Eton college , one of the richest public schools , for a gymnasium . Money was also given to the royal opera house .\r\n",
      "The lottery seemed to be a reverse Robin Hood : stealing from the poor to give to the rich .\r\n",
      "The lottery has also suffered allegations that it is addictive , especially with the introduction of scratch cards .\r\n",
      "It has been claimed that it is so addictive that people will spend all their available cash on lottery tickets , only to be disappointed .\r\n",
      "It has been calculated that only 4 pence out of every pound received by the lottery goes to charitable causes , the rest is tax the prize fund , profits , and the so - called charities .\r\n",
      "It has also been calculated that the chance of winning anything substantial is one in millions , ie highly unlikely .\r\n",
      "It has also been alleged that the jackpots are too high . Most of the lucky winners have said to themselves that the jackpot had run their lives , alienating them from friends and family .\r\n",
      "In conclusion , I think that the lottery should be retained , but not in its present form . I think that jackpots should be capped at 2 million pounds , and the prize fund shared between more people : it is better to give forty people a fortune than to give fourteen fortunes to one person .\r\n",
      "I would also remove any American business interests and give the charity money to a more deserving ' charity ' .\r\n",
      "Now that the lottery is in place , it would be very difficult to remove it from society .\r\n",
      "The computer has been one of the most influential inventions of all time .\r\n",
      "Computers now dominate the majority of government business , science and communication , as well as many other areas of human life .\r\n",
      "In many ways , it has taken the place of the human brain in performing calculations and thought processes .\r\n",
      "The most obvious example of this is the calculator , an instrument used by mathmeticians and scientists for making numerical calculations .\r\n",
      "This has made it no longer necessary for humans to perform calculations and run through equations , and so need not understand the principles behind them any longer .\r\n",
      "This , unfortunately , means that the genius scientist is being replaced by the powerful computer and its operator , who needs only to know which buttons to press .\r\n",
      "This may seem an extreme view , as there is still much in the world of maths and science which a computer can not calculate , but this may not be the case centuries into the future .\r\n",
      "Computers have been used as a means of keeping records , they have all but superseded handwritten text , ( in a few decades people may well be faced with a computer screen and keyboard in their General Studies exam ) , they are used to transfer money across the globe , even to create artwork and to entertain .\r\n",
      "Computer generated pictures , including ' fractal ' pictures , drawn from equations , seem to be more popular than hand printed images from an artist 's imagination , and computer games seem to provide more entertainment than any game or activity that takes place in the real , physical world .\r\n",
      "Virtual reality allows people to have ' 3-D ' entertainment created for them by a computer .\r\n",

      "There is also , however , the very real possibility that the power of genetic manipulation could become the possession of uncontrolled unregulated individuals who could use it for ' evil ' purposes .\r\n",

      "Though the possible effects of genetic manipulation may be far larger than a kitchen - knife or car , this is purely a subjective view by present - day standards .\r\n",
      "Certainly we would not hold the makers of a car or kitchen - knife responsible for their misuse , and there is no reason why scientists should bear the major burden or responsibility if genetic manipulation is put to misuse .\r\n",

      "Scientific research is not corrupt , but an essential and natural part of the human condition for bettering itself .\r\n",
      "The other fundamental flaw is assuming that individual scientists have responsibility . Science is a process of discovery rather than creation , ie .\r\n",
      "no - one created genetic manipulation , the power of it was there to be discovered .\r\n",
      "If one scientist does not make a discovery then another one will .\r\n",
      "It is unfair to hold responsible the scientist on the forefront of human knowledge , who discovers something when another scientist in another part of the world may make the discovery independently afterwards .\r\n",

      "\" In Vitro fertilisation \" is the fertilisation of an egg in the laboratory ie . in a testube .\r\n",

      "Once fertilisation has occured the fertilised egg is implanted back into the mother 's womb and from there on the pregnancy will be normal .\r\n",
      "Normally more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccessful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a succesful pregnancy .\r\n",
      "This usually leads to multiple births ie .\r\n",
      "twins , triplets etc .\r\n",
      "There are people who are against this , saying it is not natural and is it fair to the child having started life in a test tube , as they believe life starts from the moment of conception .\r\n",
      "There are ethics involved whereby who is given the treatment and who is n't ?\r\n",
      ", at what age should the treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitro fertilisation for one person when the same amount of money could be used to save hundreds of lives by vaccinating people against measles for example .\r\n",
      "The people who are for this can argue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their own child .\r\n",
      "Women who would not normally be able to have children can now do so with invitro fertilisation .\r\n",
      "Through no fault of her own she could have a blocked fallopian tube causing her to be unable to allow eggs down to the womb and it is only fair in helping her to have children .\r\n",
      "Technology has progressed quickly and in doing so ethics and practical guidelines have been left behind .\r\n",
      "I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations .\r\n",
      "1 . Fertility treatment should not be given to post - menopausal women .\r\n",
      "Menopause is the body 's way of telling you that you are too old and your body is no longer capable of bearing a baby .\r\n",
      "Last year there was a case of a post menopausal woman who by lying about her age was given in vitro fertilisation ( IVF ) .\r\n",
      "I do n't think this is fair or morally correct for the child since her mother would be claiming her pension when she was at primary school and her mother would probably die while the child was in her teens .... there should be a test that is given before ( IVF ) is carried out to check the mother is not past the menopause .\r\n",
      "2 .\r\n",
      "Eggs should not be taken from aborted foetuses .\r\n",
      "The foetuses would have been aborted for a reason , for example : if it was the result of a rape or if it had congenital deformities .\r\n",
      "There should be a guideline or law stating that eggs should only be taken from the mother and not from dead foetuses .\r\n",

      "People are able to have a whole new blood supply if theirs lacks sufficient requirements or , a bone marrow transplant if the blood lacks white cells .\r\n",
      "All the above are carried out on living people , but nowadays biological operations can be carried out on humans which are not even born .\r\n",
      "Bodies can start their days in test tubes .\r\n",
      "This is called ' in vitro fertilisation ' .\r\n",
      "This is when an egg is removed from a woman placed in a test tube and then sperm is placed into the test tube and the egg and sperm fuse together .\r\n",
      "The test tube is then incubated for a few weeks and when the fetus is formed , the baby is then inserted back into the mother .\r\n",
      "The fetus is left to grow and develop naturally .\r\n",
      "This idea is extremely beneficial to married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccessful and are able to have children .\r\n",
      "An in vitro fertilisation allows the baby to grow inside , which allows the mother and baby to bond and it would feel apart from her . This would not happen if the couple adopted .\r\n",
      "What I do feel is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is post - menopausal decides she wants a baby .\r\n",
      "Nature has already taken its course to tell her she is too old to have any children so why should she have one implanted into her ?\r\n",
      "It is not fair to the child because when it grows up and all its friends are playing with their 30 - 40 year old parents , its mother could be drawing her pension and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child .\r\n",
      "Also the mother may die of old age before the child has led a full life and this would be unfair to the child .\r\n",
      "The child may also have to look after the mother in her old age .\r\n",
      "As the fetus begins its life in a test tube , and the sperm is selected , this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected .\r\n",
      "The way sex can be chosen is by using genetics .\r\n",
      "The woman has 2 X chromosomes and the man has one X and one Y - chromosomes .\r\n",
      "The way in which the sex can be selected is that the egg is always X and the sperm nucleus can either contain an X or a Y chromosome .\r\n",
      "The X chromosome sperm is slightly heavier than the Y so they can be separated .\r\n",
      "If the mother wants a boy Y sperm is selected and if a girl X is selected .\r\n",
      "This may lead to an increase in one sex , and a decline in the other .\r\n",
      "As a result , this would reduce the population as there would be fewer couples .\r\n",
      "Also what happens if most people the year you are born are men and you are a woman , this would be the unpopular sex .\r\n",
      "Science is progressing all the time , but is it for the best ?\r\n",
      "The main reason for the people of Britain to stop eating beef at the moment is the threat of BSB .\r\n",
      "This is a viral disease that attacks the central nervous system which can be passed on through consuming the animal .\r\n",
      "In cows it is commonly known as mad cow disease and by law any cow showing these signs must be destroyed and not sold for meat .\r\n",
      "The problem is however the signs have not been shown for a long time , this being a viral disease .\r\n",
      "It can be passed on to humans through eating parts of the animal such as the brain which is affected and these parts are usually sold and put into fast foods such as beef burgers .\r\n",
      "The rest of the meat however is relatively safe and eating , e.g. a steak offers very little chance of the disease being passed on .\r\n",
      "However the British press has ignored this fact and blown the situation out of proportion considering only a very small number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eating beef .\r\n",
      "Another reason for the British people to stop eating beef is the push for vegetarianism , although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the former point about BSB .\r\n",
      "These factors could have a considerable impact on the agricultural industry , preventing the sale of British dairy livestock not only in Britain but for export as well .\r\n",
      "With global communications as good as they are now , it could send a scare across the world about British beef - indeed France and Germany already have restricted and some places banned the sale or import of British beef for fear of its safety .\r\n",
      "Although British farmers have learned to divert , dairy farming and the sale of beef products still form the backbone of British agriculture and would completely change the face of farming in Britain .\r\n",
      "Whether they switch to sheep or vegetable crops were made , substantial changes would be needed to change the situation .\r\n",
      "People throughout the United Kingdom were , doubtless shocked and perhaps upset by images in the national press and television news of cows who had contracted the disease bovine spungiform encephalapthy , or BSE .\r\n",
      "The so - called ' mad cow disease ' seemed to make the cows lose all sense of balance and direction , stumbling around drunkenly .\r\n",
      "The herds where this disease was found were put down before the symptoms progressed further .\r\n",
      "Those cows which had been put down were not used for food .\r\n",
      "The disease infects the cow , and is then present in the spinal fluid within the spine and the brain , and as the spinal fluid is usually spilt in the slaughter of cattle for meat , the risk of contamination of the meat was one the industry was not willing to take .\r\n",
      "The human disease , Crentzfeld - Jacob disease , or CJD , is believed to be a human form of BSE , although no clear link has yet been established between the two .\r\n",
      "It is unclear whether the incidence of CJD is on the rise , or whether awareness of the condition is heightened , but more cases from all ages have been diagnosed recently , and the disease is always fatal .\r\n",
      "The government insists , perhaps correctly , that British beef is perfectly safe to eat .\r\n",
      "However , people are genuinely scared of the presence of the disease in the U.K. , and many are abstaining from eating beef .\r\n",
      "Many schools have removed beef from their menus , substituting pork and chicken , and sales of beef have shown a decline .\r\n",
      "The implications for the beef industry could be rather serious , where everybody boycotts beef products .\r\n",
      "To compensate , beef prices have dropped , in attempts to sell more meat , but the public remains sceptical .\r\n",
      "If beef continues to fall from favour , then the beef industry 's future would be unclear .\r\n",
      "Beef products are present in many foodstuffs such as jellies , fruit gums , and of course stock cubes .\r\n",
      "Would all these products have to find synthetic or substitute ingredients ?\r\n",
      "Even if the entire beef industry were to grind to a halt , the numerous heads of beef cattle worldwide would no longer be needed , but , being bred as they are , for beef , they would be useless for milk products .\r\n",
      "Not all beef can be infected , though , and the situation has become a waiting game .\r\n",
      "For beef to be repreived or condemned , we are forced to turn to scientists to establish whether or not BSE and CJD are linked , and , more importantly , whether the latter can be contracted by eating meat contaminated with the former .\r\n",
      "The nation awaits the verdict on tenterhooks , and it is in the majority 's interests that there be no proven link .\r\n",
      "Watch this space .\r\n",
      "Personally , I believe that it is merely that man is better at diagnosing CJD now than ever before .\r\n",
      "Some reports say that it can take up to 20 years to develop , so we could all already have it .\r\n",
      "Whatever you believe , I shall continue to enjoy my roast beef and Yorkshire pudding , thank you .\r\n",
      "There has been a big scare in Britain recently that some beef may contain BSE ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) which may lead to the human equivalent of CJD ( Creutzfeldts - Jacob disease ) .\r\n",
      "BSE is a disease in cows that affects their brain and spiral tissue ( or offal as it is sometimes known ) .\r\n",
      "After a few reported cases of CJD , a similar form of the disease found in humans , it is now thought that ' mad - cow disease ' ( BSE ) is the cause .\r\n",
      "Researchers believe that eating beef containing offal will transmit the fatal disease to humans .\r\n",
      "This claim has devestated the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eat beef in case they contract the illness .\r\n",
      "Already the sales of beef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in Britain they have dropped about 6 % - 7 % .\r\n",
      "Although scientists say that to contract CJD part of the cows offal must be contained within the beef .\r\n",
      "customers are still reluctant to eat the meat in case it has come from some ' dodgy ' butcher trying to cut costs .\r\n",
      "As you can imagine , this has had a tremendous influence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants where beefburgers are the main item on the menu .\r\n",
      "An example of one is McDonalds where they have immediately brought out a notice stating that their beefburgers are made from 100% of the finest , pure beef and contain no offal .\r\n",
      "In my view , no half decent restaurant with a good reputation would risk buying poor beef in case a customer caught CJD and they managed to trace it back to the restaurant .\r\n",
      "An outcome like this would mean they would be sued for several thousand pounds and would probably have to sell up .\r\n",
      "As a result of a lower beef demand in places of food production there would be a lower need for beef cows .\r\n",
      "This means that there would be an excess of beef ( or a beef mountain ) that could not be sold .\r\n",
      "Because of this , the prices of beef would have to decrease in order to attract more customers .\r\n",
      "So , as a result of the claim that beef containing contaminated offal may cause CJD in humans , farmers ( in particular beef farmers ) are losing out as they will have to sell their meat for a lower price due to the low demand .\r\n",

      "When Women 's Lib really took off again in the late 1960s , it was again destined for failure .\r\n",
      "Immediately , the focus was on radicals like Stein , instead of the housewife who returned to college and made a career for herself .\r\n",

      "This instrument has brought other worlds right into the living room , making it possible to see life in other countries in a way that was never before possible .\r\n",
      "However , the invention of television also gave society an easy way to waste time ; one has only to turn it on to tune out reality .\r\n",
      "Television has the potential to offer wonderful things to its viewers , such as educational programming for children , cultural programs about far away places , and a closer look at current events than can not be given by newspapers .\r\n",
      "Television has the power to bring war into the home as well as artistic expressions of those involved in the program production , giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture more fully .\r\n",
      "However , this is not the way in which television has influenced society .\r\n",
      "On the contrary , television has become the escape route of the masses , a way for people to flee from the conflicts they experience in their culture , rather than confront them and try to understand them .\r\n",

      "T.V. is a major cause of lack of togetherness found in many American families , and has also resulted in an increase in laziness .\r\n",
      "The more time one spends watching TV , the less motivated he becomes ; there is no need to seek worthwhile activities when it is much easier to sit on the couch , pick up the remote control , and stare at a box .\r\n",
      "Television , therefore , has changed society in ways that could hardly have been dreamed of 00 years ago .\r\n",
      "It has given society another creative vein , a look at worlds which could be seen in no other way , and an opportunity to better educate itself .\r\n",
      "However , throughout the years , television has lost much of its integrity ; the programs offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education .\r\n",
      "The entertainment aspect of television has offered society an easy escape from its problems and difficulties .\r\n",
      "Therefore , since the invention of television , society has become more informed but too lazy to think about this new information , and has distanced itself from family life .\r\n",

      "AIDS has definitely had an impact on people in the United States and probably all over the world because it always leads to death and there is no cure .\r\n",
      "It has caused a lot of prejudice and paranoia among people which has torn them apart .\r\n",
      "For example , there is more of a stigma attached to being a homosexual male , not only because of their sexual preference , but they probably have AIDS too .\r\n",
      "This kind of ignorant thinking is breaking us apart .\r\n",
      "Also , when Ryan White , a boy who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion , was diagnosed , the people of his town and his school treated him like a complete outcast and would n't allow him to attend school .\r\n",

      "In my opinion , the discovery and harness of the atom and its energy and the corresponding invention of nuclear weapons have been the most significant factors of change in our lifetime , if not , perhaps , in several lifetimes .\r\n",

      "This sudden burst of useful compounds not only improved the chances of a patient 's survival in a hospital but also caused a great need for medical chemists to study and classify each new drug as it was discovered .\r\n",
      "As discoveries of new antibiotics decreased , chemists began to wonder if certain variations of these drugs could be synthesized and also used as medicine .\r\n",
      "It was also attempted to increase the production of naturally - occurring antibiotics through synthesis .\r\n",
      "Both of these new attempts caused a need for more research , more companies , and more medical chemists , and the industry increased tremendously .\r\n",
      "It was discovered that the older drugs could be synthesized efficiently while still remaining biologically active .\r\n",
      "New drugs were also synthesized ; some were found to be medically useful while others were not .\r\n",

      "As recently as the 1950s , it was still the most typical as well as the ideal to have a woman in the home , housekeeping and tending the children .\r\n",
      "The first significant equal rights movement in the U.S. was in the 70s with the Equal Rights Amendment , which failed .\r\n",
      "Even today , the woman is still earning something like 60 cents for every dollar that a man earns .\r\n",
      "Feminism does not only have to do with work and money , but also with the image of women .\r\n",
      "It 's only recently that we 've \" discovered \" , or begun to think about rather , how much things as varying as pornography or the language we use helps to form the image of women .\r\n",
      "A recognition of such influences on the image of women is the first step in breaking it down , so that women are seen for who they truly are .\r\n",
      "Feminism is better described as a \" discovery in progress \" ; it 's a movement , an attitude that has not yet become mainstream .\r\n",
      "Only when women have achieved equality with men will there cease to be a need for feminism , and the discovery will have been completed .\r\n",
      "The idea I feel that has most significantly changed people 's lives in the 20th century is that of caring for the environment .\r\n",
      "Today , people have become aware of the importance of the environment to our future .\r\n",
      "People are concerned about nuclear weapons .\r\n",
      "We realize that countries which have many weapons have the power to destroy the world .\r\n",
      "Also related to this topic is nuclear waste .\r\n",
      "Nuclear waste is not only harmful to humans ; it also kills animals and plants .\r\n",
      "We are now fighting for actions to clean up our lakes and rivers .\r\n",
      "Companies are no longer able to freely dump their wastes w / o being heavily fined .\r\n",
      "People have also become concerned with nature .\r\n",
      "We used to assume our natural resources were never ending .\r\n",
      "Now , though , we realize what we use , needs to be replaced .\r\n",
      "For example , deforestation is a very big issue . Many groups have formed to plant more trees .\r\n",
      "We also realize that fossil fuels need to be used more conservatively .\r\n",
      "Another important topic we are all aware of is recycling .\r\n",
      "This links 2 issues , one of not producing many nonbiodegradable products and the other of reusing what we have .\r\n",
      "( Recycling in a small way also helps those w / o homes b / c they receive money for their collections ) .\r\n",
      "Many countries realize that recycling is not only beneficial to their economy , it also is beneficial to their environment .\r\n",
      "Another important issue is conserving energy .\r\n",
      "In the past , once again , we assumed our energy was never ending .\r\n",
      "Now though , people are more inclined to turn off their lights when they 're not in their rooms , to not leave taps running and basically not to waste our natural resources .\r\n",
      "We realize that conserving is not beneficial to our environment but it also saves money .\r\n",
      "We have also become more considerate of our animal life .\r\n",
      "We are no longer able to kill animals freely .\r\n",
      "We do still raise some for food but hunting is limited and we are all aware of the possibilities of extinction .\r\n",
      "One realizes that animals have rights too .\r\n",
      "In conclusion , the idea of caring for the environment is still a new one .\r\n",
      "We are slowly becoming more aware and are beginning to take more precautions .\r\n",
      "The ideas above are just a few of the topics we are now concerned with .\r\n",
      "But we are heading in the right direction and hopefully by the 21st century we will have fixed everything we have destroyed !\r\n",
      "Computers have definitely affected people 's lives .\r\n",
      "I have a computer and my life has changed because of it .\r\n",
      "I 'm able to store almost all the information I need for school and for other things on my computer whereas before I had a computer my desk was cluttered with w/ paper and records of all sorts , I no longer need to keep these records but only to transfer them to my computer .\r\n",
      "This means I 'm able to store more information in an organized fashion .\r\n",
      "Though I have only used a fraction of my computer 's ability , I 'm still aware of the tremendous opportunities which I have or will have .\r\n",
      "Aside from being able to store great amounts of info , I 'm also able to process and edit things quickly .\r\n",
      "For example , without the use of a computer I had to balance my checkbook once a month and had to this w/ a calculator , a pen and a piece of paper .\r\n",
      "Of course , this was very time consuming and open to error . W/ the use of a computer I have programmed the computer to make the calculations which I once had to make .\r\n",
      "Also , w/ the use of the Word Processor I 'm able to edit and rearrange documents w / out altering the entire document , and furthermore , though I have yet to use the Communications program on my computer , this program seems to be extraordinarily helpful .\r\n",
      "My father has the same program on his computer and is able to buy online tickets w / out leaving the house and moreover w / out picking up the phone .\r\n",
      "Also , I realize that my experience with computers is limited and that the power of computers , for me , is incomprehensible .\r\n",
      "I 'm now here in Madrid .\r\n",
      "How did I get there ?\r\n",
      "Well , I applied to this program , was accepted , and flew here from the US .\r\n",
      "But , w / out of the use of computers I would still be struggling w/ the secretary in the International Programs Office at Boston University , no doubt .\r\n",
      "Instead , once I applied to the program- the application for which was probably computer generated- I assume my info was processed by a computer .\r\n",
      "W / out of this luxury , the International Programs Office would inevitably be inundated w/ paperwork and things would therefore be lost or at least misplaced .\r\n",
      "When booking my flight , though I did not do this myself , the transaction would seem impossible minus the aid of computers .\r\n",
      "Computers have had a most significant impact on people in the latter 1/2 of the 20th century .\r\n",
      "An invention of the 20th century that I think has significantly changed people 's lives is television .\r\n",
      "TV allows the instantaneous communication of ideas , images , news , etc .\r\n",
      "Now , if something is happening in any part of the world- from across town all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world can watch this event as it is happening .\r\n",
      "While previously people had to wait days , or even weeks for news ( which consisted of second - or third - hand accounts , which always involved much interpretation and distortion ) now they can see it happening , for themselves , as it is happening , this allows them to make their own , informed judgment about the event ; and if a reaction is necessary -- such as the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be made immediately , while the emotions are still strong , and before the action is finalized .\r\n",
      "As well , the fact that so many people ( especially in the US ) have television sets means that everybody ( well , at least everybody who watches ) receives the same inflow of information and ideas .\r\n",
      "So , for example , people in Spain can be informed about how people in California or Japan speak and act . This allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas .\r\n",
      "In my opinion , this is one part of the process of making the world a \" smaller \" , more unified place , or a \" global village \" as one journalist has called this world of the Information Age .\r\n",
      "Not only the news , but also entertainment is an important practical function of television , through television entertainment , as through literature and drama , people learn different messages about life .\r\n",
      "They can see various actions acted out to their ends , and understand the consequences of these actions , without having to perform the same actions and experience the consequences for themselves .\r\n",
      "Unfortunately these TV shows are not always accurate portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence , as well as making life seem like the good guy always wins , and always lives through dangerous situations .\r\n",
      "However , this sense of reality is not so distorted , and so hidden that people are going around acting like Superman .\r\n",
      "As long as one has a well - developed sense of reality , TV can be an excellent tool for understanding the world we live in .\r\n",
      "The waters of the culunary seas have been calm and consistent for centuries .\r\n",
      "Progress has moved slowly like the tides and the constant rhythm of the waves have shown little change .\r\n",
      "However with the daybreak of the twentyth century a storm has brewed .\r\n",
      "With this storm the waters have churned and spawned a wave that has crashed onto the rocks of every kitchen .\r\n",
      "This wave is a microwave .\r\n",
      "Never before has such an invention revolutionized science like this .\r\n",
      "A complete break has been forged in the way food is prepared .\r\n",
      "At dawn , cave men cooked animal flesh over open fires .\r\n",
      "As history progressed , spits and barbeques emerged .\r\n",
      "Technology saw the advent of the wood stove , and later ones fueled by coal .\r\n",
      "Modern times saw gas and electric ranges as staples .\r\n",
      "All these things had one thing in common : FIRE .\r\n",
      "Flame , the source of life , is always used to prepare the fool of mankind throughout history .\r\n",
      "However , the microwave uses radiation to excite water particles in food , thus creating friction , which creates heat .\r\n",
      "This is a prime example of thinking that does not follow in old footsteps but breaks away from convention and forges new routes .\r\n",
      "If this were not amazing enough , the microwave cuts cooking time in half .\r\n",
      "If you had told someone 100 yrs ago that you could cut cooking time in half , and not use fire , they would have thought you crazy , or bewitched , or under the influence of heavy drugs .\r\n",
      "In an age where time is the scarcest commodity , our society has embraced this eliminator of wasted hours in the kitchen .\r\n",
      "A mother who works , can come home can whip up something in minutes in the microwave , whereas before she would have been slaving in the kitchen .\r\n",
      "The microwave is excellent for re - heating , making it easier for people to make excess food to be eaten later .\r\n",
      "Again time is conserved -- Children are able to use this simple device without parental fear of fires starting .\r\n",
      "As I have said before , there is no fire !\r\n",
      "This marvel of technology has helped propel people into the dizzying pace of life that most of us lead in the 20th century .\r\n",
      "Throughout History one can see that great revelations in all areas come from breaks in tradition , new insights , and different perspectives .\r\n",
      "All these were needed to create the microwave which is essential nowadays .\r\n",
      "Eating is something everyone must do .\r\n",
      "This device has sped up one of our most important activities and thus revolutionized life in the fast paced 20th century .\r\n",
      "When I was in tenth grade a teacher said that the 2 most important inventions that made possible the idea of a repressive government were the machine gun and the radio .\r\n",
      "A machine gun can be used to keep civil peace and enforce Marshall Law .\r\n",
      "The radio can be used to communicate ideas and , under a dictatorship , propaganda .\r\n",
      "In the 20th Century the machine gun has not changed all that many lives ( except for those that it ' s killed ) , but the invention of radio has made a tremendous impact .\r\n",
      "The idea behind the radio is simple .\r\n",
      "There is one transmitter and it sends its signals through the air and waves , with potential for millions of receivers .\r\n",
      "In the 20th Century , radio has become a source of information and entertainment .\r\n",
      "The radio keeps people informed .\r\n",
      "I don ' t think any people of my generation can even comprehend now that our lives would be different .\r\n",
      "Every morning I listen to the weather forecast and dress accordingly .\r\n",
      "At night one can sit by the radio and hear how the events of the day unfolded .\r\n",
      "Radio , hence , gives people the option of becoming passive observers rather than active participants in the news making process .\r\n",
      "Newspapers had been around for many years but it was not until the invention of radio that the power of the media became evident .\r\n",
      "Radio gives the ability to reach many more people instantly .\r\n",
      "As a form of entertainment , radio and its most important and now more common offshoot , television , has changed people 's lives .\r\n",
      "A typical day for a child in today 's world consists of going to school and coming home to watch TV .\r\n",
      "There have even been forms of entertainment , for example videogames , made for this other form of entertainment .\r\n",
      "Nowadays everybody watches TV .\r\n",
      "My seáora , for example , is over 100 years old , and for her T.V. is the greatest thing in the world .\r\n",
      "She sits in front of it all day and it keeps her happy .\r\n",
      "Television offers soap operas , game shows , sit - coms , sporting events , movies and much more to keep us entertained 24 hours a day .\r\n",
      "In short , I don ' t know what life was like before radio , but its invention has changed the way we see and do things .\r\n",
      "A current ideology in the United States today is for one to be successful , one must follow all of the written and unwritten rules of society ,\r\n",
      "Everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and when one does not do this one fails .\r\n",
      "One can see these ideas in popular media everyday .\r\n",
      "T.V. commercials and T.V. programs project models of how one should be .\r\n",
      "In the 20th century , the values of / that the United States was founded on have changed in meaning and sense when applied to modern day America , nothing was ever equal .\r\n",
      "And today , since the invention and utilization of modern technologies such as computers , life for Americans moves at a much faster pace .\r\n",
      "People are more mobile , can work more , and buy more things , but time for relaxation and family are often substituted with T.V. In America , this growing individualistic society , one no longer sees the realistic humanness between people , instead one sees the differences , the unlucky , the unsuccessful , and attributes their inadequacy to a lack of effort .\r\n",
      "With everyone moving at such a fast pace , the gaps are easy to miss . The voices of the mass media easily replace those voices that struggle to be heard .\r\n",
      "The parts of the new machine that need to be oiled and regulated .\r\n",
      "When Voltaire wrote Candide , a literary style known as Neoclassicism was at its peak .\r\n",
      "There was a group of scholars in France , l'Academie Franáais , that set guidelines for French literature .\r\n",
      "According to l'Academie Franáais , all literature of the Neoclassic period must follow the rules of propriety which regulate the author should avoid certain topics , including sex , violence , church , and state issues .\r\n",
      "Another standard upheld by the Academie is the idea of verisimilitude , making literature as realistic as possible by keeping the time , setting and plot true to life .\r\n",
      "Voltaire , as a Neoclassicist , knew all these regulations and followed them in his literature .\r\n",
      "However , when writing Candide , Voltaire defied the Academie 's rules .\r\n",
      "Candide is a parody of the guidelines of Neoclassicism .\r\n",
      "Neoclassicists liked literature to have good manners : they did not want to step on anyone 's toes by mentioning sex , violence , church , or state issues .\r\n",
      "In Candide Voltaire did not seem to mind stepping on toes - in fact , he did not mind smashing feet !\r\n",
      "Voltaire went beyond the comfort level when he mentioned sex .\r\n",
      "He told of the two girls of Orellion who were lovers of monkeys , and of the Baron who bathed with the Musselman and was punished for his homosexual act .\r\n",
      "Sex turned into violence when Cunegonde was being raped by a Barber , and witnessed his murder while he was on top of her .\r\n",
      "The wise old woman underwent the removal of a buttock by pirates , as well as experiencing rape .\r\n",
      "After the Baron is caught bathing with the Mussalman , he receives 100 lashes for his sin .\r\n",
      "Candide stabs the Baron , a Jesuit priest , after the Baron forbids Candide 's marriage to Cunegonde .\r\n",
      "Ironically , although Voltaire mentions many acts of violence , each act is treated lightly : Cunegonde and the old woman both tell their tales of being defiled like an entertaining story in their conversations about their travels ; the Baron also continues his tale with style after telling of his beating ; and after Candide \" kills \" the Baron , he leaves to search for Cunegonde with no second thought until he reencounters the Baron later in his travels .\r\n",
      "The light attitude in which these acts of sex and violence are written shows the parody form in which Voltaire writes Candide .\r\n",
      "Voltaire chooses not to stay away from church and state issues .\r\n",
      "He attracts the hippocracy of the Church with the old woman 's father being the Pope .\r\n",
      "When Candide visits the land of Eldorado , Voltaire shows the people 's perfect relationship to God : they only praise God because there is nothing they want from God .\r\n",
      "Voltaire uses this perfect relationship to God in an unrealistic situation to foil society 's imperfect relationship with God in the real world .\r\n",
      "Voltaire makes fun of the aristocracy in his description of the Baron , who came from 71 generations of nobility but still lacks gentilesse .\r\n",
      "Candide and his companions dine with 6 dethroned kings who represent the overimportance society places on hierarchy .\r\n",
      "In his portrayal of the utopian society of Eldorado , Voltaire toils the imperfections of our society .\r\n",
      "According to Lunde , 35% of homicide victims are killed by someone they know .\r\n",
      "Statistics from 56 are greater than Lundes ' thesis .\r\n",
      "Frustration is the main factor most implicated in these tragedies .\r\n",
      "Most cases are those of the \" trigger pulling the finger \" .\r\n",
      "Today , racial prejudice still exists , but less action has taken place than 30 years ago .\r\n",
      "Thirty years ago , minorities could n't ride a bus , vote , or go to school with white people .\r\n",
      "Desegregation reduced some prejudice , but it still exists .\r\n",
      "The difference is , today social prejudice is not openly expressed as it was 30 years ago .\r\n",
      "I would tell the client to be extremely nice to that person and do favors for that person .\r\n",
      "That person would then feel obligated to do nice things back and return favors .\r\n",
      "This is based on the eauity theory .\r\n",
      "It would be better for the client to do nice things for the person that it would be to ask a favor of the person .\r\n",
      "Someone who lives in the north who comes to live in the south may not be prejudiced toward Blacks at first .\r\n",
      "After living in the south for a while , they may adopt southern attitudes toward Blacks and feel prejudice toward them .\r\n",
      "This is conformity .\r\n",
      "The same goes for Southerners who move north .\r\n",
      "They come to feel prejudice toward Jews .\r\n",
      "I know someone who has lived all over the world .\r\n",
      "He is prejudiced toward Jews , Blacks , and Mexicans .\r\n",
      "He adopted white attitudes against minorities in the different regions he has lived in .\r\n",
      "Our country has been coined a \" melting - pot \" inferring that we all come from different backgrounds but have joined or melted together to produce homogeneous Americans .\r\n",
      "But a person 's heritage , as we are realizing , is important to their sense of self and community .\r\n",
      "Ethnic American cultures have been reviving and trying to reestablish roots that were once lopped off to a model U.S. citizen .\r\n",
      "The differences they are rediscovering only add more color , flavor and excitement to that brewing \" pot \" of our people .\r\n",
      "However , some individuals and even groups of Americans are reacting negatively to this ethnic explosion ( seen most clearly through the arts ) .\r\n",
      "They do n't want to accept these differences .\r\n",
      "They choose to remain indifferent to the plight of their fellow Americans .\r\n",
      "As Ellie Weisel , author of such books as Night , says about indifference : it is the opposite of everything good .\r\n",
      "The opposite of love , beauty , intelligence , light , joy , life and growth are not their familiar ontonyms but indifference .\r\n",
      "Ethnic American literature tries to fight this indifference by vividly and uniquely expressing certain aspects of different American culture .\r\n",
      "The gamut of ethnic American literature is without bounds .\r\n",
      "Each group has its own peculiarities and attributes that make its writing unique .\r\n",
      "In many cases the words used in ethnic American literature reflect a knowledge of a different \" mother tongue \" .\r\n",
      "For instance , Native American poetry is more expressive and visual partly because their language is deeply rooted in the observation of the natural environment .\r\n",
      "Chinese American Literature is philisophical / literal because their native language is so .\r\n",
      "African American literature is often melodious and rhythmic mirroring their similar achievements in Jazzy and Blues music .\r\n",
      "All these examples ( and more ) give us some insight into other cultures we would otherwise never know .\r\n",
      "The stories told in this genre of literature , however , are likely the most important aspect of Ethnic American literature .\r\n",
      "It is through the experiences of the characters that we learn about the different cultures in the United States .\r\n",
      "When we learn of the trials and hardships that they went through we can sympathize with their emotions and try to accept that diversity .\r\n",
      "The stories of black American slaves and of concentration camp victims are necessary to avoid indifference .\r\n",
      "Without learning about the past ( and present ) horrors , there is no way to ensure future humanity .\r\n",
      "Ethnic American literature benefits U.S. citizens in many ways .\r\n",
      "It opens our eyes to the reality of the suffering of others .\r\n",
      "It gives us a fresh and new perspective on the world around us .\r\n",
      "It helps us to understand our personal relationships better .\r\n",
      "Most of all , it gives us more common ground on which to live , grow , and prosper .\r\n",
      "Hopefully we will someday fulfill Elie Weisel 's goal and end indifference ; this literature is a step in the right direction towards acceptance in the diversity of our country .\r\n",
      "The difference is beautiful !\r\n",
      "Violence on television can be seen throughout the many channels that cable has to offer .\r\n",
      "With an average national TV viewing time of 7 1/4 hours daily , the prevalence of violence in broadcasts is a serious concern .\r\n",
      "Television programming in the United States is considered the most violent in advanced industrialized nations ( Hepburn 1 ) .\r\n",
      "Many children watch violent TV shows because the action thrills them and can sometimes cause the child to become violent .\r\n",
      "Violence is common in TV entertainment-- the dramas that portray stories about crime , psychotic murderers , police cases , emergency services , international terrorism , and war ( Hepburn 1 ) .\r\n",
      "Television violence is prevalent in the United States and some people disagree with its effects on children .\r\n",
      "The V - chip is an electrical device that blocks out violent television shows .\r\n",
      "Some people , such as the Senate Commerce Committee , are not satisfied with it .\r\n",
      "The Senate Commerce Committee approved bills creating a partial ban on TV violence and a so - called report card that would identify stations carrying violent programming and the advertisers sponsoring it .\r\n",
      "The bills would apply to broadcasting and cable ( Stern 1 ) .\r\n",
      "Some of the proposals for antiviolence are as follows : the Senate V - chip , the House V - chip , a Technology Fund , a Violence Safe Harbor , and a Violence Report Card .\r\n",
      "These proposals could work if Congress had some support .\r\n",
      "The National Association of Broadcasters accused the Senate of \" piling on a stream of proposals to build up an unprecedented federal censorship bureaucracy \" .\r\n",
      "The NAB also insisted that broadcasters already have responded to concerns over violence on television ( Stern 1 ) .\r\n",
      "Some television shows show violence because it appeals to adult viewers .\r\n",
      "If a certain plot involves a murder , then the murder must happen .\r\n",
      "Some people may not want the actual murder to be shown , but that is up to whomever is writing the television show .\r\n",
      "Many made for television movies say that it may contain violent scenes and that viewer discretion is advised , but how many parents actually watch television with their teenagers ?\r\n",
      "An exhaustive examination of the broadcast networks ' programming during the 1995 - 1995 season has concluded that sinister combat violence pervades a significant number of Saturday - morning cartoons ( Jensen 1 ) .\r\n",
      "How much violence is there ?\r\n",
      "The most violent cartoons are ' Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ' , ' Spider Man ' , and some ' Bugs Bunny ' episodes with Elmer Fudd .\r\n",
      "As for the shows containing sinister combat violence , well that is strictly up to the viewer to decide .\r\n",
      "The cause of television violence is to add texture to the show and not to poison children 's minds .\r\n",
      "The infamous V - chip may stop some shows from being shown to children , but one day that child will see violence and they will have to deal with it , rationally or not .\r\n"
